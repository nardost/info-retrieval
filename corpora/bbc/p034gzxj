Delia Radu reflects on the 'Decade of the Roma Inclusion'. In 2005 a plan was launched to improve education, health, housing and jobs for the Roma – Europe’s poorest minority. But did it succeed? Ten years later Delia Radu travelled across Eastern Europe to find the Roma she spoke to when the plan was launched. Delia wanted to ask the people who the plan was supposed to help - if it delivered its promises and if anything changed. (Photo: A Roma woman serves supper in her kitchen) Show less
