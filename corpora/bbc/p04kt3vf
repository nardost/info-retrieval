In 1996 Dominique Moceanu made headlines as the youngest ever member of the US women's gymnastics team to win a Gold Medal at the Olympic Games - she was only 14 years old. Watching her from afar was Jennifer Bricker, a little girl in Illinois who was born without legs but was still determined to become an acrobat. They tell Outlook's Matthew Bannister the story of how their lives intersected in the most extraordinary way.
