Gaby Gillespie from Wales was sold into marriage in Yemen when she was just 13 years old. She overcame murder, suicide and domestic abuse to raise her five children and she now campaigns to stop other girls being forced into child marriage. She has written a book about her experiences called A Father's Betrayal and tells Matthew Bannister her remarkable story. The American screenwriter and director Ryan Coogler has resurrected the character of Rocky - the underdog boxer first played by Sylvester Stallone 40 years ago in the Oscar-winning film. Ryan's new film Creed tells the story of Adonis - the son of Rocky's great rival and later friend, Apollo Creed - as he seeks out Rocky Balboa to train him to be a fighter like his dad. Ryan tells the BBC's Samira Ahmed why making the film was a labour of love for Ryan. Pushpesh Pant is to many people the face of Indian food - but he is not a chef. For decades he was professor of International Relations at a Delhi university, but early on in his career he came to believe that pretty much everything relates back to the food we eat. He became one of the country's foremost food experts, and gained international renown with the publication of several books, including India: Cookbook. He tells Matthew when his fascination with food began. For centuries man has dreamed of being able to fly like a bird, but a Chinese man from Henan Province called Shi Songbo has gone one step further. He has spent 300,000 Yuan ($45,000 dollars), of his savings building his very own airship. He told Matthew Bannister why. (Photo: Gaby Gillespie: Credit: Gareth Iwan Jones Photography) Show less
