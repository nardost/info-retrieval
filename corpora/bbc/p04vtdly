In October 1972, Pedro Algorta was a 21-year-old student living in Montevideo when he boarded a Uruguayan Air Force plane bound for Chile. The fate of the 45 people on that small plane has inspired countless books, documentaries and a Hollywood film. More than 40 years later, Pedro decided to tell his story. In August 2015, Californian airman Spencer Stone was enjoying the holiday of a lifetime. The 23-year-old was with a couple of friends travelling around Europe by train. One Friday evening they were making their way from Amsterdam to Paris. As the train was crossing the border into France a man was emerging from a toilet cubicle with an assault rifle and a backpack full of ammunition. What happened next turned Spencer into an international hero. Georgia Durante was once one of the most photographed women in America. No one suspected that while she was working as a model in 1970s New York, she was also a getaway driver for the mafia. (Photo: Car driving over the speed limit is flashed by speed camera.
