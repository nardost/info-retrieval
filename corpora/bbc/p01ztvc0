In 2008, Jonny Benjamin stood on a bridge over the river Thames in London and was about to take his own life. But a stranger passing by stopped and talked him down. Jonny and Neil Laybourn, the man who saved him, tell their story. Ida Beate Loken has been living in a cave in western Norway for the past year. She had been studying at an agricultural college, but decided to turn her back on conventional student accommodation.
