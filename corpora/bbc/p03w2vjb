Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Latin America's violent conflicts. Many are buried in mass graves or as "no names". One team is helping to identify those that have gone missing over the past four decades. The Argentine Team of Forensic Anthropology (EAAF), are a world-renowned scientific squad unearthing the evidence and listening to the stories that the bones of fatal victims of violence have to tell. In episode one, Valeria Perasso and Alejandro Millán discover how the team was born and came to embrace a politically relevant task with scientific tools. They visit their lab and learn how they make bones speak. And, they speak to the sons, daughters, mothers and brothers who have received the remains of their long-sought “disappeared” from the forensics’s hands. What do these bones mean to them?
