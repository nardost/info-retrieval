Doreen Giuliano is a New York mother who went to staggering lengths to try to get her son out of jail. Her story involves a false identity, hot pants, and an operation she called The Sting. The crime that started it all happened in October 2003. A 19 year old college football star called Mark Fisher was found shot dead on a street in Brooklyn early one morning. He had been at a party nearby hosted by 20 year old John Giuca - who was arrested, along with a teenage friend, Antonio Russo. Both were found guilty of murder and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. John Giuca’s mother, Doreen Giuliano, just couldn’t believe it. Bird strikes - where birds collide with planes - happen very often. They are rarely dangerous, except occasionally when they can bring down a plane, like the case of the 2009 US Airways Flight that had to make an emergency landing in the Hudson River. In Ecuador there is a woman tasked with protecting people travelling in planes and the small birds around the airport by scaring them with birds of prey. Her journey to this job has taken her to near death experiences and into the depths of the Amazon jungle, as reporter Clayton Conn found out.
