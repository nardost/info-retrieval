When Dada Nguru, a traditional midwife from Nigeria, fled Boko Haram, she delivered the babies of other displaced women the road. In March this year, Russian adventurer Alexander Gubin was one of two men who cut a hole in thick sea ice and descended 102 metres to set a new world record for the deepest dive under ice. In 1999 Tommy Douglas from Scotland lost both his legs in a nail bomb attack on a gay pub called the Admiral Duncan in London's Soho district. This year, Tommy decided to go to London's gay Pride parade for the first time in 17 years to show his support for the victims of the recent attack in Orlando. Finnish author, punk singer and performance artist Kati Hiekkapelto lives in a farmhouse on a tiny island in Finland where she is setting up a refuge for writers and artists in danger from around the world.
