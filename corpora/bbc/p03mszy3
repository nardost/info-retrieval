Fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian troops around the airport of Donetsk has been going on for two years. The villages and towns near the airport have mostly been abandoned. But in the village of Peski, Anatoliy and Svetlana Kosse - who are both seventy years old - are still living in their home in the midst of the bomb damage. Marc Brew is an Australian dancer and choreographer. In his latest work he re-creates the experience of waking up in hospital at the age of nineteen to find himself paralysed from the chest down. Since then Marc has used a wheelchair. The artist talks about the impact of that life changing accident on his work. Christopher Beck was proud when he joined the elite US special forces - the Navy SEALs. He graduated top of his class and was admired for his tough, macho approach. Although he didn't take part in the operation, it was his team that killed Osama Bin Laden. But then, in 2013 Christopher announced that he would be starting to live as a woman - and wanted to be known as Kristin Beck. Image: Anatoliy and Svetlana Kosse Credit: BBC Show less
