Mahavir Singh Phogat has always been fanatical about wrestling. He did some amateur wrestling himself, but he did not reach the heights he had hoped to. So, dreaming of an Olympic gold medal, he decided to train his two daughters, Geeta and Babita, to be champion wrestlers. Kim Fisher was born into a family of diving enthusiasts in California. His father, Mel Fisher was obsessed with the idea of finding treasure. He had read that there were many wrecked Spanish galleons which had sunk in the 17th Century with cargoes of gold worth millions of dollars. And, so the Fishers went fishing for gold.
