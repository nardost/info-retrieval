Academic expectations, job competition and financial pressures are forcing some young South Koreans to give up on relationships, marriage and kids. This phenomenon is known as the ‘sampo’ or ‘give up’ generation. The daily struggle to succeed within a patriotic and competitive culture is a shared experience. The suicide rate in Korea is the second highest among developed countries. In recent years, the quality of life reached such a low point, young people started referring to the country as, ‘hell Joseon’. While some maintain it is an exaggeration, others use the phrase to describe their difficult reality. It is a sentiment older South Koreans have trouble accepting, considering the hardship their generation went through when rebuilding the economy after the Korean war, in the early 1950s. But despite the challenges, not all young Koreans are prepared to give up on traditional life stages. ABC producer Mike Williams travels to South Korea to hear the unique personal stories of students and young people. They share their individual perspectives on Korea’s competitive character, how they endure expectations from their parents and why they have hope for the future.
