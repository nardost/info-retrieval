Amrou al-Kadhi - who goes by the pronoun ‘they’ - was raised Muslim, but even as a kid Amrou was different. They wanted nothing to do with other boys and loved dressing up with their mother. Amrou grappled with issues of gender identity and sexuality for years. It was not until they picked up drag as a student at Cambridge University that they were able to find solace and belonging. Amrou has written a book called Unicorn: The Memoir of a Muslim Drag Queen. Amrou spoke to Outlook’s Jo Fidgen. Mirko Trasciatti is a professional chess player who runs a chess club in a high security prison. (Photo: Amrou al-Kadhi as Glamrou. Credit: Holly Falconer) Show less
