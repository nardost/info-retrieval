Steadman Scott used his prison sentence for drug dealing to turn his life around. He opened the Afewee Football Academy in Brixton, South London. Now some of the young players Steadman's coached are playing for Premiership sides and even for the England Football Team. Archaeologist Becca Peixotto has been called an "underground astronaut" because she squeezes through tiny gaps, some as small as 18 cms, in ancient underground caves. Becca's expeditions into the bowels of the earth have led her to uncover a new human-like species. We remember American historian and adventurer Nancy Hatch Dupree, who recently died aged 89. She devoted her life to preserving Afghan culture until her very last days. Many in Afghanistan felt Nancy was a national treasure. She spoke to Outlook in 2009. Indonesian musician Mike Marjinal had a difficult journey into punk music, but is now inspiring street children in Jakarta to express themselves through this genre of music. Outlook's Mehulika Sitepu goes to meet Mike to find out why the ukulele is so important for his style of punk. Image: Steadman Scott Credit: Afewee Training Centre Show less
