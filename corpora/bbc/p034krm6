Gulwali Passarlay grew up in eastern Afghanistan, not far from where the al-Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, had his stronghold. Gulwali's family were very pro-Taliban- his uncle was a senior commander - and Gulwali grew up hating the West and all it stood for. He has been on a phenomenal journey since then - both physically and mentally. As a 12-year-old he made the journey, by himself, from Afghanistan to the UK, facing one catastrophe after another. Now 21, he is a final year student at a leading university in Britain. When Melody Gardot was a teenager in the American city of Philadelphia she was knocked off her bicycle in a road accident and suffered brain damage. She was also left with chronic pain and walking difficulties. Using music therapy as part of her recovery, she discovered a talent for singing and playing the guitar. She is now a Grammy winning recording artist who has sold millions of records across the world. Chester Williams was a star player of South Africa's rugby world cup winning team of 1995. Rugby had always been seen as a white sport in South Africa, and black rugby fans tended to support anyone but the all-white national team. Chester was the only black player, and the team's success helped unite the Rainbow Nation. (Picture: Gulwali Passarlay) Show less
