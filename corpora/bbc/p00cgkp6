Justin Elzie US senators have recently voted by 65 to 31 to overturn the 1993 "don't ask, don't tell" law, which barred gay people in the military from revealing their sexual orientation. One man who had campaigned for the change in the law was former US marine Justin Elzie. In 1993, he became the first person to be discharged from the marines on the grounds of his sexuality under the "don't ask don't tell" law. But he took the army to court and was eventually re-instated to serve four more years. He tells Matthew about his journey. Justin's book 'Playing by the Rules' is published by Rebel Satori Press.
