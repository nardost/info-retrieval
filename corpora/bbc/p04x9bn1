Mohammad Sayed is originally from the Panjshir Valley in Afghanistan. A spinal cord injury left him in a wheelchair and when his father took him to hospital, he left Mohammad there. To earn money, he started repairing people's phones and teaching English. Mohammed went on living in the hospital for seven years. Then he was adopted by a nurse who took him to the US. After getting over the initial culture shock, Mohammad decided to create his own comic book hero, based on his own life, called Wheelchair Man. Gary Bell is one of the UK's top lawyers and specialises in complex fraud cases. It's surprising given he's a man with a criminal record of his own, for cheating fruit machines. Now, he holds the prestigious title of Queen's Counsel. Liz Murray was brought up in New York in the Bronx by parents who were both drug addicts.

By the time she was 20 she was a student at Harvard - one of America's most prestigious universities. Image: Cheeky monkeys. Credit: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images. Show less
