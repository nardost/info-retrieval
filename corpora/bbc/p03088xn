Silas Ntamfura was in the Rwandan army in 1994 during the country's genocide. As more and more people were killed, he felt he couldn't just stand back and do nothing. So, he began smuggling Tutsi people over the border to safety in Burundi. He tells Matthew Bannister how he ended up marrying one of the women he saved. Doug Allan likes to get close to wild animals - often in the most inhospitable conditions. He's an award winning wildlife cameraman, known in the business for his expertise in filming underwater and in extreme cold. He has contributed spectacular footage of whales, polar bears and other large mammals to TV series presented by the British naturalist Sir David Attenborough. Now in his mid 60s and still working in the most inhospitable climates, Doug has written a book entitled Freeze Frame that looks back on his life. Thousands of young Japanese men - and some women - suffer from a condition known as hikikomori. It means "withdrawn" - and describes people who cut themselves off from society, often hiding away in their bedrooms for years on end. Dr Takahiro Kato from Kyushu University in southern Japan treats people who have the condition - and even experienced it himself when he was younger. The children's book illustrator Dub Leffler is an Aboriginal Australian who grew up in a white household. He finally met his birth mother when he was 25 and discovered more about his ancestry. The relationship between different cultures in Australia forms the backdrop for his new illustrated children's book "Once There Was A Boy". Kim Chakanetsa met Dub at the Edinburgh International Book Festival and he told her what inspired his book. (Picture: Silas Ntamfura) Show less
