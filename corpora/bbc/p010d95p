Dorian Lynskey is a music writer for the Guardian newspaper and other publications. His account of protest songs from around the world â€“ 33 Revolutions Per Minute was published last year by Faber and was widely praised. His audio essay looks back on growing up in the British pop explosion of the 1980s and how it shaped his political and cultural outlook on the world. From Frankie Goes To Hollywood and their shattering predictions of nuclear war in 'Two Tribes' to the global fusions and connections of South Africa's Spoek Mathambo covering Joy Division's She's Lost Control.
