Scottish teenager Cora Bissett got a five album deal when she was just 17, but then her rock star dreams came crashing down. She went from partying with Blur and Radiohead to being submerged in debt. Cora is now a respected actor and she has a stage show called 'What Girls Are Made Of'. During the civil war, Beirut was divided into two isolated districts - East and West. Marwan and Elie are two men from either side and they fought for rival militias. But their common passion for motorcycles brought them together, and they are now close friends. Laxmi and Binod Gaire met in hospital in Nepal where they were both being treated for leprosy. It was love at first sight. Laxmi and Binod got married and they now have a baby girl. They have also been accepted by their families, who once ostracized them. Picture: Group picture of indie band Darlingheart Credit: Ronnie McGuigan Show less
