As the United Nations gears up for a new decade of action to improve road safety across the world, Sheena McDonald looks at whether its lofty ambition to save five million lives over the next ten years can work on the ground. Road deaths are threatening to overtake malaria and HIV, in how many lives they take around the world, particularly in poorer countries. In this two-part series, Sheena visits some of the world's most dangerous roads in Kenya and Costa Rica to find out why the death toll in developing countries is rising - when the solutions to road accidents are so simple. The Millennium Development Goals push countries to work hard to improve the mortality rates for children under five, but there are no goals to stop those same children being knocked down when they start school. Follow Sheena - who was nearly killed by a speeding police car just over ten years ago - as she visits accident blackspots, meets victims and people campaigning for better road safety, and challenges those in power who do not believe it is important enough.
