Last year in an address to Parliament, President Jacob Zuma admitted the country has a greater problem with violent crime than anywhere else in the world. One man trying to tackle this is Judge Mohamed Jooma, who's been called Soweto's strictest judge. Lucy Ash finds out how earned his tough nickname.
