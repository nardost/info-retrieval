The 1999 Reith Lecturer is Professor Anthony Giddens. Professor Giddens was Director of the London School of Economics and his writings have been used by world leaders, including Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, to develop ideas on what become known as 'The Third Way' in politics. He was Professor of Sociology at the University of Cambridge from 1986-96 and took up the post as Director of the London School of Economics in 1997. He has been described as 'Britain's best-known social scientist since Keynes'. The lectures are delivered from five major cities around the world, locating the lectures themselves within the cultural variety of the world across which they were broadcast. In his first lecture, delivered from London, Professor Giddens examines the concept of globalisation and how it has affected our lives. Show less
