Chris Wilson grew up in a violent neighbourhood in Washington, USA. By the age of 13 he was already carrying a gun to protect himself. At 16, he had already buried five of his friends. On a summer night in 1996 Chris got involved in a street fight and killed a man. He was sentenced to life in prison for murder and thought his life was over. But while serving his sentence Chris completed a ‘masterplan’ which won him another chance at life. Khadjou Sambe is changing the world of surfing in Senegal. She is the only Senegalese woman affiliated with the World Surf League and the only real contender for the women’s team at the Olympics in Japan, where surfing will feature for the first time next year. But as a female athlete, Khadjou had to fight discrimination to get to where she is now. Jennifer O'Mahony went to meet her on Dakar's Yoff beach. British wildlife photographer William Burrard-Lucas works with local rangers in Africa to capture some of the most rare and memorable wildlife photos of our time, like the elusive black panther and Kenya's 'Elephant Queen'. His book is called Land of Giants. Image: Chris Wilson Credit: Jai Lennard Show less
