South African child cancer specialist Cyril Karabus was travelling home with his family from a wedding in Canada, when he was suddenly arrested while in transit in Dubai, on a murder charge relating to the death of a patient in Abu Dhabi ten years earlier. Although all the charges against him were dismissed, he spent more than two months in prison and a further seven months unable to leave Dubai. Matthew Bannister spoke to him and to his daughter Sarah, who campaigned for his release. When Vivana Morales was divorced from her husband she decided to take up a new hobby. The grandmother from Argentina wanted to keep fit - so she took up pole dancing. She won the title of National Pole Dancing Champion at the age of 47. The Lebanese singer Yasmine Hamdan has been called the modern face of Arabic music. She mixes contemporary Western and traditional Arabic styles. She tells Matthew about her peripatetic childhood. James Klokow grew up believing that he was responsible for the death of his baby sister, but 56 years after her death, he brought the real culprit to justice: their mother. And the member of the Nepalese Royal family who witnessed their shooting. Image: Professor Cyril Karabus with his daughter Sarah Credit: Tessa Frootko Show less
