Insha Mushtaq was 14-years-old when she was blinded in both eyes by pellets fired by the Indian army at protesters in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2016. She thought she'd never be able to study again, but this year she passed her all-important high school exams. And we hear from Dr Tariq Qureshi, the eye-doctor who treated her wounds. Casey Anderson is a naturalist and filmmaker who opened a bear sanctuary in Montana after rescuing a baby bear. Brutus the grizzly now weighs 800lbs and was the best man at Casey's wedding.
