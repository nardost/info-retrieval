Angel Getsis is a schoolboy from Greece who's come up with a gadget which could help blind people navigate the streets safely. At just 17 - but he's been given an award by Google for designing a pair of glasses which vibrate when a solid object is near. Pakistani artist Imran Qureshi has made his name creating very tiny paintings, and extremely large ones. They earned him the title 'Deutsche Bank artist of the year' in 2013.
