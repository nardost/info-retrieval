Last Broadcast Date: Thu 9 Apr 2015
Night Of The Lovers is a three hour phone-in radio show for the lovesick teenagers in Afghanistan. It is broadcast once a week on the privately owned station Arman FM. We meet show's creator. Songwriter and activist Peggy Seeger is one of the leading lights of the Anglo-American folk music tradition. With her late husband Ewan McColl, she wrote the song The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, which was a huge hit for Roberta Flack in the 1970s. John Wilson went to meet her. All this week we have been looking at farming around the world. Suhail Haleem has been to Haryana, one of the most fertile areas in India, to meet lawyer turned crop farmer Aftab Ahmad. Miguel Farragoso owns a very unusual cocktail bar in the Spanish city of Seville. Bar Garlochi is in a cave of religious artefacts and kitsch statues with ceremonial music blaring out of the speakers. Rafael Estefania went to the bar to meet him.
