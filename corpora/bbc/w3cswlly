Waleed Khan and his fellow pupils were getting first aid training when their school was attacked by militants from the hardline Islamic Taliban movement in December 2014. More than 100 children died in what would be the deadliest attack by the Taliban in Pakistan's history. Waleed tells Outlook's Saskia Edwards how he miraculously survived but was so badly injured that staff in the hospital initially thought he had died. Waleed's father describes the extraordinary moment he finally found him alive at the hospital and Waleed's cricket coach in Birmingham in the UK describes the moment Waleed came to his cricket academy. In the late 1970s American Michael Fishbach was one of the world's top 50 tennis players, but he always had another passion.... blue whales. Michael is founder of Great Whale Conservancy and spends his life trying to stop their numbers from dwindling - there are maybe 25,000 left in the world which puts them in the endangered category. Michael tells Outlook how he was able to save a humpback whale called Valentina. Image: Waleed Khan Credit: Saskia Edwards Show less
