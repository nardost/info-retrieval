The town of Ii in northern Finland is a green trailblazer. It has managed to stop burning fossil fuels and will have reduced carbon emissions by 80% by 2020; that is 30 years ahead of the EU target. It is also aiming to be the worldâ€™s first zero-waste town. It is happening because of the collective effort of the community. Erika Benke discovers how everyone is involved; from local businessmen to the mayor and from schoolchildren to their parents and grandparents - all play their part in making Ii the greenest town in Europe. With the help of a young climate champion Erika hears their stories and meets the people making pancakes from leftover food for a Christmas party; the children checking if all the lights have been switched off at school at the end of the day and the scientist on a mission to restore one of Europe's biggest peatlands. And they meet the people who still need persuading; the residents who are unhappy about the new wind farm and who are resisting change. The inhabitants of Ii hope that they can show the world what individuals can do to make a difference to climate change. (Photo: The town of Ii in northern Finland. Credit: BBC) Show less
