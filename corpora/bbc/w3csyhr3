When South African Vuvu Mpofu was a teenager in Port Elizabeth, she saw La Traviata on DVD for the first time and it made her fall in love with opera. At first, her family didn’t approve of her opera obsession and her friends even mocked her. But Vuvu was determined and started studying opera at university, eventually changing their minds. A year before graduating, her mother died and it was then that opera came to her aid. Rather than counselling sessions, she turned to the art as it “soothed her soul.” Vuvu is now performing at one of the world’s most prestigious opera houses, Glyndebourne in the English countryside. She says that every time she takes to the stage, she thinks of her mother. Marine biologist Professor David Scheel wonders what it’s like to be an octopus. He kept octopuses in an aquarium at his university to study their behaviour. Obviously he couldn't spend his whole life at work so he decided to bring one into his own home to observe it day-to-day. The BBC documentary about him and Heidi the octopus is called The octopus in my house. You can find more information here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07kpmn1/p07kpm8m.
