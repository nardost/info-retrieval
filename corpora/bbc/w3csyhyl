Todd Ross came out as a gay man after being forced to take a lie detector test. He was in the Canadian military, and the confession - which cost him his career - was during the country's ‘LGBT purge.’ He tells his story to Emily Webb. When New Zealander Emma Ebrahim's grandfather died, she was given all his war memorabilia from World War Two. It included an old black and white photograph that Emma had always been curious about - a portrait of three Greek siblings. She set out to track them down and revealed a family who saved her grandfather's life from the Nazis. Hashim Aslami eats, sleeps, and breathes saffron. He says that he would even wear it as a perfume. For the past few decades, he's been on a one man mission to cultivate saffron in Afghanistan. (Image: Todd Ross on HMCS Saskatchewan in 1989.
