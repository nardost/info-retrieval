Artist Jessamyn Lovell turned her camera on her estranged father. She told Jo Fidgen why she decided to become a private investigator. Roya Mahboob thought of computers as magic boxes when she was growing up in Afghanistan. As a girl, she was also not encouraged to work in tech. So she decided to set up her own company - and employed mainly women. South African divers Craig Foster and Ross Frylinck dive into the kelp forests just off Cape Town.
