Contagion - how commerce spreads disease. Laurie Taylor talks to Mark Harrison, Professor of the History of Medicine, about the close intertwining between trade and germs from the 14th century to today. His new book explores the development of public health in the Western world as well as the global misuse of quarantines for political ends. Also, young men working in retail. The sociologist, Steven Roberts' research finds evidence for a new and softer kind of masculinity. He's joined by Professor Valerie Walkerdine, who's documented the changing relationship between men and work in a post industrial economy. Producer: Jayne Egerton. Show less
