Redd Pepper is a voice over artist, famous for his deep baritone commentary on movie trailers. He was born in Barbados, raised in the US before finally settling in the UK. He has done all sorts of films, but how he got to that point was almost purely by chance. Redd used to work as a train driver on the London Underground when his deep booming passenger announcements got him noticed by talent spotters. Dr Musa Manzi is one of South Africaâ€™s most celebrated young scientists. He recently graduated with a PhD in geophysics, reportedly becoming the first black citizen in his country to do so. But this historic accomplishment came after a lifetime of challenges, as Mpho Lakaje found out. Louisa Deasey is a writer and journalist based in Melbourne. She is the youngest of three siblings and she was only 7 years old when her dad, Denison Deasey, died of cancer. He had separated from Louisa's mum and was considered the black sheep of the family. As she grew up, Louisa didn't know much about him. But then, decades later, a complete stranger from Paris got in touch and started Louisa on an emotional journey of discovery. Louisa wrote a book about her experiences called "A letter from Paris". Image: voice over artist Redd Pepper sitting in front of a microphone Credit: Saskia Edwards Show less
