During Sierra Leone's decade-long civil war, thousands of children were conscripted to fight. Prince Tommy Williams was among them and had an horrific experience. But today Prince leads a very different life. Working with an organisation called the Lifeline Nehemiah Project he is devoted to rebuilding Sierra Leone. During the recent ebola outbreak, he risked his life to take food to the thousands of people trapped in communities infected by the disease. Valerie Taylor - and her late husband Ron - were the Australian filmmakers who shot the underwater shark footage for the hit 1970s movie Jaws. Their ability to get up close and personal with sharks has meant that their work has been used in many of the documentaries and feature films about the creatures in the past forty years. But Jaws didn't quite have the effect on the shark's public image that they were hoping for. Sahar Assaf has been described as one of the most important theatre artists in the Arab world. The Lebanese actor and director's works have highlighted issues in her country's society from the aftermath of the Civil War to women's rights. But when she was starting out, it was a struggle for her to be allowed on the stage at all. American Layne Mosler has an unusual hobby - she hails the first taxi that comes along and asks the driver to take her to their favourite restaurant. She's done this Buenos Aires, New York and Berlin and even became a taxi driver herself. She writes a blog about her experiences and now that blog, Taxi Gourmet, has changed the course of her life.
