This week on the Forum: how do we find meaning from unaccustomed experiences and gaps in our history, and how does this change the way we think about ourselves. Swedish evolutionary biologist Svante Pääbo shares with us his search for our missing early human ancestors, and his findings about how our for-bears spread across the globe. American writer and former diplomat Terry Tracy vividly describes the epilepsy that has permeated her life with unpredictable and traumatic breaks in consciousness, and explains how she recovers the lost time. And Senegalese-French anthropologist Hélène Neveu Kringelbach explores how secret dance societies and cross dressing rituals in West Africa allow people to momentarily step out of their day to day lives.
