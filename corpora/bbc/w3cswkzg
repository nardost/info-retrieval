Cameron Underwood tried to take his own life by shooting himself in the face, he survived, but with severe facial injuries. Doctors told his family his face was "dust". He didn't think he'd be able to smile again, until he met Dr Eduardo Rodriguez who performed a 25-hour face transplant to reconstruct his face. The donor was 23 year old Will Fisher and his mum Sally told Outlook's Jo Fidgen that she wouldn't have survived her son's death without knowing his face was going to help someone else survive.
