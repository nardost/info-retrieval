Do you ever worry about who might be looking over your shoulder? It is a hot topic at the moment - the shadowy world of tracking and surveillance. As smarter and smarter technology monitors our behaviour online, and even our physical movements in the workplace, how far should we be prepared to compromise privacy in the interests of security and efficiency? And how can the same technology be employed to better track endangered species? Bridget Kendall discusses these issues with Finnish cyber-security expert Mikko Hypponen, Kenyan vulture scientist Munir Virani, and Australian political geographer Anja Kanngieser.
