Pete Ouko became the first legally trained prisoner in Kenya. He's helped people on both sides of the prison walls. Pete's now been pardoned and released and his services are in great demand. There are some 150 circuses in Chile but only two of them have human cannonballs. That is because it is an extremely risky act and you have to be very specially trained to do it. Outlook’s Jane Chambers went to meet Matute Alvarez to find out what it takes to be a human cannonball. It’s South Africa’s most iconic photograph – a dying 12-year-old school boy, Hector Pieterson, being carried away after he was shot by police during the 1976 Soweto Uprisings. The picture, taken by journalist Sam Nzima, exposed the horrors of apartheid to the world. Reporter Gavin Fischer follows the incredible stories of the people affected by the photo, both in front of and behind the camera. Image and credit: Pete Ouko Show less
