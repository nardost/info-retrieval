Jennifer Klinec travelled to Iran to learn cookery but ended up entering a temporary marriage after meeting a man. She discusses first dates at camel slaughter houses. When the Berlin Wall came down in Germany in 1989, many people moved from the impoverished East to the West, leaving buildings abandoned. These became a children's playground for a young Christian Richter. He now spends his time photographing their decaying interiors. Shandra Woworuntu went from a very comfortable lifestyle to being forced to work as a sex slave - almost overnight. In the late 1990s, Shandra was working as a financial analyst in Indonesia. She had a nice house, a decent salary and a happy family life with her husband and young daughter. But then she lost her job in a financial crisis, her husband fell ill with cancer and passed away - and suddenly Shandra needed work. She then applied for a job in the US. (Picture: Jennifer Klinec.
