In 2006 Jameel McGee was arrested and sent to prison for 10 years, he was innocent. Two years later, Andrew Collins, the police officer who arrested Jameel was found to be corrupt. His lies had led to 62 people being jailed when they shouldn't have been. The two men met by accident years later and something extraordinary happened. They have written a book called 'Convicted'. Neil Harbisson has a condition that means he only sees in greyscale. Throughout his life people would talk to him about colour, but when your world is entirely black and white, it's very difficult to understand. But when he was at university Neil met another student and together they developed an antenna that would translate colours into music notes. Neil underwent a controversial surgery to have the antenna permanently implanted in his skull. He now considers himself a cybernetic organism - a cyborg.
