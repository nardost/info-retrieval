A new history of ideas presented by Melvyn Bragg but told in many voices. An opportunity to hear all this week's programmes in this Omnibus edition. Melvyn is joined by four guests with different backgrounds to discuss a really big question. This week he's asking 'How should we live together?' Helping him answer it are the historian Justin Champion, economist Kate Barker, and the philosophers Angie Hobbs and Timothy Secret. Across the week Justin, Kate, Angie and Timothy took us further into the question, with programmes of their own. They examined ideas about tolerating others, respecting our ancestors, the morality of the Free Market, and Plato's ideas about the importance of philosopher rulers. This omnibus edition has all five programmes together. Show less
