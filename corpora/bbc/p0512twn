When American Shujaa Graham was sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit, he ended up on death row. It was there he met his future wife, Phyllis Prentice, who worked as a nurse in the prison. Shujaa was finally released from prison in 1981 after being exonerated. He now campaigns against the death penalty. The famous Ritz Hotel in London has had a resident pianist for the past twenty-two years. His name is Ian Gomes and he's known for being able to play anything from Taylor Swift to Tchaikovsky. During his career - spanning an incredible fifty years - he's also got to play for some rather famous people, including his idol Frank Sinatra. Emily Webb went along to meet Ian at his favourite spot - in front of the piano in the hotel's Palm Court. Image and photo credit: Shujaa Graham and Phyllis Prentice Show less
