Rana Mitter chairs a debate about World History at the Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival, with historian Antony Beevor, broadcaster Andrew Marr and India expert Maria Misra. Does World History really still mean Western History, or do we need a radical new understanding of the past? Antony Beevor is our leading military historian and author of the best-selling history books The Second World War and Stalingrad. Andrew Marr's landmark series A New History of the World aired on BBC1 last year, and he has published the book A History of the World. And Maria Misra is Fellow in Modern History at the University of Oxford and author of Vishnu's Corwded Temple, India since the Great Rebellion. The event is hosted by Chinese History expert and Radio 3's Night Waves presenter Rana Mitter, and was recorded as part of Radio 3's Free Thinking Festival 2012. First broadcast in November 2012.
