The psychiatrist in Nigeria treating growing numbers of people who've been traumatised by violence in the North East of the country. Many are victims of the militant group Boko Haram, which has been fighting to overthrow the government and create an Islamic state. Hungarian poet and writer, Zoltan Boszormenyi, made millions selling lightbulbs to Romania. He grew up during the dark days of Ceaucescu's dictatorship and fled the country as a young man, ending up in Canada. In his third novel - The Club at Eddy's Bar - Zoltan draws on his own experience in an Austrian refugee camp as the setting for a mystery in the final years of the Cold War. Antonio Spano is an Italian filmmaker who stumbled across a community of deaf people in the Democratic Republic of Congo - and made a film about their lives. They are often shunned by the rest of society - and seen as cursed. Antonio's film is called The Silent Chaos. And the self-proclaimed cycling superhero - Lewis Dediare AKA Traffic Droid - who sets off round London on his bike and tries to make the streets safer for other cyclists. He films every journey he makes and reports motorists driving badly to the police. Militant leader believed to be Abubakar Shekau (centre), with armed and masked Boko Haram militia.
