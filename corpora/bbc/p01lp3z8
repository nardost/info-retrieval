Has the Asian concept of 'Fortune' been the key to Hong Kong's economic success but also a limitation on its creativity? In a special programme recorded at the Hong Kong Literary Festival, Bridget Kendall asks if this dynamic yet conservative city, could in future, measure up creatively to its neighbour China and other countries in the region. Perspectives from banker-turned-novelist Phillip Kim, neo-Victorian specialist Liz Ho, screenwriter Ivy Ho and designer Danielle Huthart.
