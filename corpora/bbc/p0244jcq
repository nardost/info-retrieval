Saa Sabas from Guinea talks about how he survived the Ebola virus that he caught from his father in April this year. After Saa recovered, the people of his neighbourhood were afraid to come into contact with him, but the neighbourhood Chief took him by the hand to show he wasn't contagious any more. Saa is now campaigning to fight the misconceptions about the virus. Nicola Benedetti has been playing the violin since the age of four, and was just 16 when she won the BBC's Young Musician of the Year competition. She is now acclaimed as one of the world's leading violinists, and has recently been turning her attention to traditional Scottish music. Reporter Candida Beveridge meets Dr Bubi Arce who retrieved the bodies of over two thousand people killed when Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines last November. Thanks to Dr Arce, they are now laid to rest at the Holy Cross cemetery in Tacloban, each with a proper burial site. Tindy Agaba is a former child soldier from Rwanda who suffered terrible trauma in his early life. As a teenager he fled Rwanda for the UK, and after a chance meeting he was adopted by the Oscar-winning British actress Emma Thompson and her actor husband Greg Wise. Tindy is now 27 and has graduated from university with an MA in Human Rights Law.
