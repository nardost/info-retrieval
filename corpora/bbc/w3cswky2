Tyler Perry has had a remarkable life. As a boy he would use his imagination to escape the violence of his father and he's been using it ever since. He's created some of the most loved characters in American entertainment - in particular with his alter-ego Madea, the self-proclaimed "mad, black woman". As well as being an actor he's also a director, producer and playwright. Tyler tells New York presenter Joe Pascal how he went from being homeless and sleeping in his car to being the first African-American to have his own film and TV empire, and one of the biggest studios in the world.
