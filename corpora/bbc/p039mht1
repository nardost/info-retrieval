Maggie Doyne was just nineteen when she first visited Nepal, but it made such an impression, that she has spent the last ten years building an orphanage and school there. During this time she has adopted fifty-one Nepali children and as she tells Jo Fidgen, the coming winter is set to be a challenging one due to the current blockade at the Indian border. Kuwaiti novelist Saud Alsanousi isn't afraid of tackling controversial issues. He's written about the impact of the Gulf wars, relationships between Sunnis and Shiites, and the Arab Spring. One of his books, The Bamboo Stalk, won the prestigious International Prize for Arabic Fiction, and has now been translated into English. He tells Outlook's Andrea Kidd about the book, which highlights the poor treatment of migrant workers in Kuwait. What's music to your ears?

Anna's just won an award for her work and tells us where she gets her inspiration from. Norwegian novelist Lars Mytting has become something of a celebrity since writing a factual book called: Norwegian Wood: Chopping, Stacking and Drying Wood the Scandinavian Way. It even inspired a twelve-hour long primetime television programme in Norway - eight hours of which was simply a live feed of a fire burning. It was massively popular. Lars joins Jo Fidgen in the Outlook studio to tell her why Norwegians are so fascinated by wood. Show less
