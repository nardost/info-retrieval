As Syria's conflict becomes increasingly violent, more and more people are fleeing their homeland. One of the Syrians who sought refuge abroad is a school teacher who we are calling 'Amal Ahmed'. She fled with her young family to the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan and has been using her experience to help children in a new school that has just been set up there. When she lived in London, Ayan Hussein worked as an advisor to wealthy fashion conscious women. It was a world away from her upbringing in war torn Somalia. But three years ago, Ayan decided to go back to her homeland. She settled in Hargeisa, the capital of the breakaway Somaliland region and started a restaurant and clothes shop. After dropping out of school aged fifteen, Dale Vince lived as a traveller - drifting around music festivals, protesting against cruise missiles and simply surviving. He finally settled down, living in a truck on a hill near Gloucester, England. But in the early 1990s he decided to drop back in to mainstream society and set up a green energy company that made him a millionaire.
