The close links between sport and national identity are all too evident in many countries today. Democrats and demagogues alike have at times used sport to plunder and unite their people. In his second Sporting Chances programme Farayi Mungazi focuses on the common image of Australia as a sporting nation. He looks at the role of sport in shaping the country's national identity and asks whether sporting success will always be part of Australia's soft power. (Image: Athlete Cathy Freeman.
