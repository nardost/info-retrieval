This week's programme will be the last edition of One Planet - so we've put together a rather nostalgic look back at the last few years. We've been on air in various forms since 1997, covering environmental news and international development, looking at the way we live our lives on this planet and the consequences. We've been all over the world, from the rainforests of Borneo to the roof of the Vatican to the Fire Mountains of Azerbaijan. We've spoken to some fascinating people - not just big names like David Attenborough or Kofi Annan - but also to the ordinary people whose real lives have been affected by the issues we cover. We've talked about everything from climate change to bioengineering to the wonders of the mushroom. It's been great fun for us, and we hope that you've also enjoyed the ride. But don't worry - Mike will be back in September with his new show The Why Factor. Watch this space for more details. Thanks to everyone who's spoken to us on One Planet over the years - and also to everyone who's helped us out by fixing interviews, driving us around, feeding us, translating for us, and so on. And most of all, thanks to you for listening. Goodbye! Show less
