Emma Sky is a British civilian who had 10 years of experience of conflict mediation between Israel and the Palestinians, and volunteered to go to Iraq in 2003 just after Saddam Hussein was deposed. She quickly found herself in charge of governing a whole province of the country and ended up advising one of America's top generals in Iraq. Also, we speak Dao Anh Khanh, one of Vietnam's most famous and flamboyant performance artists and painters. In a country where art and culture is still censored by the government, Khanh stands out. He himself used to work as a secret policeman, and his role was to censor artists. Until one day when he saw a film about the work of the secret police in East Germany and realised the horror of what he was doing. We also hear from a teenage boy who managed to invent a cancer detection test when he was only 14 years old. Jack Andraka shares the story of his startling discovery with Outlook.
