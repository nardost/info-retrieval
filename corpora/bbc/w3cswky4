John Buultjens started life on a rough Scottish housing estate with a violent, drunken father. After being adopted and watching the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, he was introduced to the BMX, an off-road bike for racing and doing stunts on. Suddenly John had a dream, and the vehicle to make it happen. He lives in Los Angeles now, the home of Hollywood, and actually ended up playing his own abusive father in a film about his life. Freddy Mamani has changed El Alto, a city in the Bolivian Andes. He's an architect, possibly the most famous in the country. His extraordinarily bold, brightly coloured buildings in geometric designs dominate the city. Some people say they look like flamboyant spaceships. But they're more than simply striking constructions. They're about his roots, and his desire to revitalise indigenous culture. Joyce Maynard is an American newspaper columnist. She's used to getting fan mail. But one day, she got a letter that really stood out. It was from a prisoner in California, and signed 'Grizzly'. Joyce wrote back and they began corresponding. Their relationship deepened, but behind his nickname was a terrible secret. Main Image: John Buultjens doing a stunt on his BMX. Photo Credit: John Buultjens Show less
