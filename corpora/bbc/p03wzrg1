In northern Colombia, survivors of a decades long conflict have decided to take their destiny into their own hands. Fighting between the state, left-wing rebels and some right-wing paramilitaries has left nearly seven million people displaced. It's been ten years since a group of women got together and decided to create a new kind of community, one where the women were - at last - in control. BBC's Natalio Cosoy reports from the 'City of Women'. Wil Baptiste and Kevin Sylvester - the classical violin hip-hop duo Black Violin on mixing Busta Rhymes with Bach and performing at Barack Obama's inauguration. Saber Hosseini - the Afghan school teacher who fends off threats from the Taliban to cycle across the mountains of Bamiyan with a mobile library, delivering books to children in remote villages who otherwise would have no access to story books.
