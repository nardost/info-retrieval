Ajeet and Deeya Bajaj are the first Indian father-daughter duo to climb Mount Everest. They tell Outlook's Matthew Bannister about how they can conquer the world's highest peak, but can't endure a driving lesson together! If you go for a stroll in the Italian city of Milan you might come across a man sitting on a chair with a placard that reads "I listen to love stories for free". The man holding it is Salvino Sagone - he tells Outlook his story. British reporter Lola Almudevar was a rising star of journalism. Having started her career at the BBC, she decided to go to Latin America and ultimately Bolivia where she ended up working as a freelance reporter in 2007. She was 29 years old and fluent in Spanish, and although she'd only been there for six months she had already got an exclusive interview with President Evo Morales and was building a reputation for her original stories about ordinary people. But on the morning of 25th November 2007, as she was travelling to cover a story, the taxi she was in collided with two trucks which had already crashed. Lola was killed, along with four others. Her death was a huge loss for everyone who knew her - her family, her friends and all of her colleagues at the BBC. Today would have been Lola's 40th birthday. Monica Stoppleman, Lola's mum spoke to the BBC's Allan Little about her daughter's life. She has set up a fund in Lola's name to help women and journalists working in Bolivia.
