Former US Army sergeant Ryan Henderson formed a strong bond with his dog Satan during their tour of Afghanistan. Satan was trained to sniff out bombs and improvised explosive devices or IEDs, but when Ryan fell ill, he was separated from Satan. He spent years looking for his companion. Dr Rebecca Dali has devoted her life to helping poor and disadvantaged people in her native Nigeria. Most recently, she risked her life to help women and girls captured by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram. Cristina Mittermeier is a Mexican photographer and marine biologist with the ocean conservation campaign group Sea Legacy. She told the BBC's Kim Chakanetsa about being part of the team behind a video and photograph of a starving polar bear wandering across a land without ice that's gone viral online. Ghislain and Emmanuelle Bardout are extreme divers on a mission to explore the most remote areas in the world. They never travel alone though and for their last expedition they took their whole family with them - including two children and a dog. Image: Ryan Henderson and Satan Credit: Ryan Henderson Show less
