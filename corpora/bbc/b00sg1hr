From Curtis Mayfield to 50 Cent, from Nina Simone to JayZ, black music has declined in its quality and lost its moral stance. That's the contention of the cultural critic Paul Gilroy. He joins Laurie Taylor and Caspar Melville to discuss the counter-cultural stance that black popular music once had, and explore whether it really has been destroyed. Producer: Charlie Taylor.
