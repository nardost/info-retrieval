Dr Izzeldin Abuelaish lost three daughters when an Israeli shell hit his home during the 2009 Gazan conflict. Izzeldin went on to become a high-profile campaigner for peace in the Middle East. He's written a book entitled I Shall Not Hate, and set up a charitable foundation in the memory of his daughters. From her earliest years Krithi Karanth went into India's forests with her family to watch tigers and leopards. Now she leads a team of conservationists at Bangalore's Centre for Wildlife Studies, who are working to understand more about conflicts between humans and the natural world. David Best is an American artist, most famous for designing huge and ornately carved temples for The Burning Man Festival, a celebration of all things alternative held in the Nevada desert.
