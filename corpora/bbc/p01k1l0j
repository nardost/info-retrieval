Documentary maker Havana Marking gains extraordinary access to the inner workings of an international criminal group made up of 200 people, who came together out of the chaos and criminality of the Balkan Wars. Nicknamed The Pink Panthers, they are a gang that steals jewels from high end stores all over the world. Their hallmarks are intensive planning and extraordinary speed. Havana speaks to 'Leila', who would pose as a rich customer to gain access to jewellery shops before the raids. “I was extremely good looking,” she says. Her looks meant she easily got a job in one target shop and gained key information. Her story is contrasted with that of 'Mike', an expert safe cracker. “Everybody has their specific job to do, understand?” he says, describing how the group became bigger and more ambitious. And, Havana speaks to the police forces who are now working together with increasing effectiveness to foil the Panthers’ crime spree. Show less
