Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, the reluctant lama - the three-year-old American boy whose life changed forever when he was recognised as the reincarnation of an eminent Buddhist teacher. Ever since he's wrestled with the conflict between the modern Western culture he was born into, and the expectations of Tibetan tradition. Also, the Malaysian Muslim transsexual challenging the Islamic authorities for the right to wear a dress in public. And the British man who auctioned off his entire life on the internet following the breakdown of his marriage. He then set off around the world to attempt 100 adventures in 100 weeks. He's written a book about it called "A Life Sold". Show less
