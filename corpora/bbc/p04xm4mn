Remembering the South African anti-apartheid leader Ahmed Kathrada who died this week aged 87. Ahmed was a prominent ANC activist and close friend of Nelson Mandela. They were arrested in 1963 and in what became known as the Rivonia case, they were both sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour. Ahmed spoke to Outlook's Matthew Bannister in 2010 about his memories of the first day of that sentence.
