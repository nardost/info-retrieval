Forty-five percent of the population of Myanmar is 25 or under. This gives young adults a key role in the country’s first open election in 25 years, to be held on 8 November. Nomia Iqbal spends time with producers at youth radio programme Lin Lat Kyair Sin (or Bright Young Stars). Their team are running an unprecedented Youth Question Time event, putting Myanmar's young people face-to-face with politicians. It is an important chapter in the country’s continuing shift from military rule to full democracy. (Photo: Presenter Nomia Iqbal) Show less
