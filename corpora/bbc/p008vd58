WES MOORE A remarkable story of two men who share the same name and grew up in the same deprived part of Baltimore in the United States, but whose lives took very different courses. Both men are called Wes Moore, both are African American - one escaped a rough and tumble childhood to become a model of achievement - a Rhodes scholar and at one point a Special Assistant to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The other was sentenced to life in prison for his role in a botched robbery that resulted in the death of an off-duty police officer. The two men are now friends and you can hear the extraordinary story on Outlook. CAUCASUS WAR STORIES - SOUTH OSSETIA Tom Esslemont travels to the breakaway region of South Ossetia, which has fought two wars in the last two decades. He meets a man who's been living in a tent since his home was destroyed in the fighting of 2008, when Georgia tried to reimpose its authority. And he visits a deserted Georgian village where the only building left standing is the church.
