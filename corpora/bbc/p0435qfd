A small toy balloon floating free into the sky. A giant hot air balloon filled with passengers peering down at the ground. Classic images, but what about the huge balloons now being developed to help us explore outer space? Or the tiny balloons which bio engineers inflate inside your body to help blood surge through your veins? Or the extraordinary balloonomania that spread across Northern Europe in the late 18th century? Bridget Kendall explores the colourful history of the balloon and its even more intriguing future with guests: Debbie Fairbrother, Chief of NASA’s Balloon Programme Office. Professor Claudio Capelli, cardiovascular engineer from the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London. Fiona Stafford, Professor of literature from Somerville College, University of Oxford.

The balloon’s operational float altitude is 110,000 feet (33.5 kilometers) (Credit: NASA/Bill Rodman) Show less
