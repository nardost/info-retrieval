Terry Gobanga is a Kenyan pastor who was raped by a gang of men on her wedding day. Her husband died just 29 days after their marriage and because of these tragic events she was shunned by her community who thought she was 'cursed'. Terry tells Matthew Bannister how she turned her life around. Professor David George Haskell is a big fan of trees. For his last book he chronicled a single year in the life of a one-metre-wide patch of forest in the American state of Tennessee, examining each moment of its life in detail. Then he set himself a new task - to visit 12 different species of tree around the world, from olive groves in Jerusalem to bonsai trees in Japan to examine their connections to the world and also record their sounds. David George Haskell's book is 'The Songs Of Trees'. The actress Pamela Nomvete became a household name in her native South Africa when she starred in a popular TV soap opera called Generations. She had the fame and fortune she had dreamed of - but it didn't make her happy. In the end she threw it all away and finished up down and out. Pamela tells Matthew Bannister how she fought her way back and found her true calling. Believe it or not, Tuesday 25th April is World Penguin day, which coincides with the animals' annual northward migration. Some people on social media took the opportunity to share a story we covered about a surprising friendship between a man and a penguin and we thought you might like to hear it again. Tom Michell is an Englishman who moved to Argentina in the 1970s to work in a school. While he was on holiday he visited a beach in Uruguay where he came across a distressing sight.
