We hear the extraordinary story of the Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim and former opposition leader, a man who has twice been jailed for sodomy and is now Prime Minister-in-waiting after a dramatic election which swept aside the ruling party after six decades in power and turned his old arch-enemy Mahattir Mohamad into his ally once more. Our chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet speaks to Anwar Ibrahim and asks whether the two men can really work together and whether Mr Anwar can trust that he will become prime minister of Malaysia one day.
