Regina Louise grew up in the American state of Texas. Her parents were not able to look after her so she was left in the care of a string of people, one of whom abused her. Regina went into care where she met her one ray of sunshine, a youth counsellor called Jeanne. However, she was separated from her by a system that felt inter-racial adoption harmed children. Amy Peake is working to set up a refugee staffed factory for sanitary pads, based in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. Donia Jamal Adam and Mohammed Ibrahim Shire are campaigning online to change the negative perceptions around their fellow Somalis. They've created an online platform called Somali Faces - which includes extraordinary stories from Somali people around the world. Including a woman who found a baby on her doorstep, and a man known as the 'human radio station'. Ayad Akhtar's latest play 'The Invisible Hand' tells a story of kidnapping and Islamic militancy in contemporary Pakistan. (Photo: Jeanne Kerr and her adopted daughter Regina Louise.
