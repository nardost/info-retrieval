Start the Week focuses on justice, fairness and ethical dilemmas this week. The leading Marxist historian, Eric Hobsbawm tells Andrew Marr that the inequalities inherent in capitalism has made people question its supremacy, and he argues that Marx remains as relevant today as in the last century. While the American academic Michael Sandel looks at the philosophy that underpins notions of justice, and unpicks the sometimes contradictory nature of morality. In her new play, Tiger Country, Nina Raine explores medical ethics and the huge toll working in a busy hospital takes on staff. And Azzam Alwash, an Iraqi water engineer, is seeking to right the wrongs of the past and restore the marshlands of his homeland to their former glory. Producer: Katy Hickman. Show less
