Episode 5/6. Our view of Egypt has been focussed on the capital. Yet much of the population still live in rural areas, with ways of life that have changed little for decades. Shaimaa Khalil accompanies a young revolutionary back to his home town in Upper Egypt to hear about discrimination, poverty, the role of religion and of women and asks whether the revolution is likely to change anything so far from Cairo.
