Mozhdah Jamalzadah is known as the 'Oprah of Afghanistan,’ due to being inspired by The Oprah Winfrey Show. She actually grew up in Canada after her family fled their home in Kabul. It was in Canada that she started singing songs about what was happening to women under Taliban rule. She then launched her own TV show in Afghanistan, using it as a platform to discuss women’s rights issues. But one episode pushed her audience too far… it resulted in bomb threats, death threats and threw her life into turmoil. Mozhdah has just released a book about her life called Voice of Rebellion.
