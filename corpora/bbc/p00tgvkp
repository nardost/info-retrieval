Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, what's it like to be in a polygamous marriage? We hear from Joe Darger and his three wives - identical twin sisters Vicky and Valerie and their cousin Alina. Between them they have 23 children and they all live together in a large house outside Salt Lake City, Utah. They say they are part of a group of about 30,000 fundamentalist Mormons who practice polygamy in the USA. Polygamy is illegal in America and banned by the mainstream Mormon church. However, authorities in Utah say they don't routinely prosecute people who practise it. The Dargers have decided to speak out to challenge the suspicion and prejudice which they say they face because of their lifestyle. They describe their experiences in the book Love Times Three.
