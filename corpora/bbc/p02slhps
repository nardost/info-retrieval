Pioneering human rights lawyer Hina Jilani set up Pakistan's first all-female legal aid practice together with her sister and often defies death threats to do her job. For the last 50 years Justo Gallego Martinez has been building a cathedral with his own hands using recycled materials. The former monk lives inside his creation which lies just east of the Spanish capital Madrid. Guy Hedgecoe went to meet him. Agnes Igoye's childhood in Uganda was overshadowed by the brutality of Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army. The rebel group is notorious for abducting children and making them commit atrocities. These days Agnes is an employee of the immigration service, and uses her knowledge of the LRA to identify fighters and their victims. One of the people she's caught is a wanted LRA commander. Amol Sateh is a Dalit, the lowest of India's castes. Although born into a poverty, his mud-wrestling skills have helped him fight his way to a better life.
