Mads Peder Nordbo used to write crime thrillers from his home in a quiet, Danish, village. It was a world he imagined, but never experienced. But in 2013, fact and fiction blurred when he stumbled across a murder next to his house. His latest book is called Cold Fear. In June 2019, Joy Harjo became the 23rd Poet Laureate in the US, becoming the first Native American in history to be awarded the post. Her poems are deeply rooted in indigenous histories and myths but part of her inspiration comes from music, including the Miles Davis tracks her father played in the car when she was a child. Joy's latest poetry collection is called An American Sunrise. Picture: Mads Peder Nordbo Credit: Courtesy of Mads Peder Nordbo Show less
