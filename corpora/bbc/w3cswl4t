Moder Magid was just 22 when he became Sweden's most wanted terror suspect. Following a massive manhunt in 2015, the Iraqi asylum seeker was arrested and taken to Stockholm where the Swedish security services interrogated him before releasing him and clearing him of all suspicion three days later. Moder says he isn't bitter about the experience and threw a huge party in his town afterwards, in an attempt to bring locals and refugees together. Underneath the city of Naples lies a vast network of tunnels that have been carved out over the last 2,500 years. Some of them were used as aqueducts and others as bomb shelters during the Second World War, before more recently becoming filled up with rubbish. But geologist Gianluca Minin is now working to restore the underground network and plans to open it to the public. Swazi pastor Bakhe Dlamini is challenging perceptions about parenting by encouraging men to take a more active role in raising children. He wants more fathers to change nappies and carry their kids, but admits his ideas are still controversial. Image: Moder Mothanna Magid Credit: Firas Hatem Show less
