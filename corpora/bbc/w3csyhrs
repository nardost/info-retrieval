Edis Kolar guarded a lifesaving tunnel built in the basement of his family home during the siege of Sarajevo. The secret passage provided a safe way to move people and supplies in and out of the surrounded Bosnian city. Edis tells Outlook's Mariana Des Forges how he lived in the tunnel house for the whole war, alongside other soldiers and his grandmother who refused to leave, helping the thousands who crossed through the passage every day. When the war ended Edis turned his home into a museum to honour the ‘Tunnel of Hope’ that saved the city. Is a genius born or made? Susan Polgar’s psychologist father had a theory that he wanted to test, and he chose to experiment on his daughter. He instructed her how to play chess from an early age, and by the time she was 15 Susan was the best female chess player in the world. By 21 she was a grandmaster. She tells Jo Fidgen how she defied those who told her she couldn’t compete with men. Picture: Edis Kolar at the 'Tunnel of Hope' Credit: BBC / Mariana Des Forges Show less
