Jason Rezaian was the Washington Post's bureau chief in Tehran. But a tongue-in-cheek campaign to bring avocados to the country caught the attention of the authorities and landed him in Iran's most notorious prison. Jason wrote a book about his experience called Prisoner: My 544 Days in an Iranian Prison. Jo Cameron has a rare genetic condition - known as 'the happy gene' - that means she doesn't feel pain. It was only discovered by chance when she was in her mid-sixties. Jo had to have an operation on her hand, but when the doctor talked to her about the kind of pain relief she would need afterwards, Jo's reaction wasn't quite what he was expecting.
