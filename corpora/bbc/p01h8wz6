Rebecca Musser tells Matthew Bannister about growing up in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. In the sect, which practices polygamy, she was forced to marry the 85-year-old self-styled prophet of the church. She tells Matthew how she managed to escape the sect and start a new life. Also we hear from Rene Silva Santos, the young Brazilian journalist who shot to twitter fame when he became the voice of the Favelas. The film director Woody Allen will be reflecting on his attitude to his work and his critics. Plus, we meet the white South African couple who spent a month living in a township.
