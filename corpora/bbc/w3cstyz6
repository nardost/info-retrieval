Rebecca Rusch's father was a US pilot who bombed the Ho Chi Minh trail during the Vietnam War. Huyen Nguyen's father collected the bodies of his neighbours after bombs were dropped. Now Rebecca and Huyen have cycled the trail together to come to terms with their past. If you're in New York and there's a bees nest that needs dealing with you can call the police. You can do that thanks to one former police officer who, on top of the kind of crime fighting duties you'd expect, had a more unusual role. His name is Anthony 'Tony Bees' Planakis and Colm Flynn has been to meet him. Zannah Mustapha is very well known in Nigeria as one of those who secured the release of some of the Chibok girls. He started his career as a lawyer, and now runs a school in north-eastern Nigeria for orphans whose fathers died on both sides of the conflict with Boko Haram militants. He tells Outlook about his school. Iain Cameron from Scotland, spends much of his free time searching for snow, he's what's known as a professional 'snowpatcher'. Iain explains to Outlook exactly what that means and why he feels so passionate about it. Image: Rebecca Rusch (R) and Huyen Nguyen (L) Credit: Red Bull Media House Show less
