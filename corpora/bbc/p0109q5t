Pak Asih has taken over from his father as the gate keeper of Indonesia's most active volcano Merapi. He tells us about his memories of his father who died when the volcano erupted two years ago. Also, we meet John Samson, the 12-year-old orphan from Malawi whose life story brought him to London to meet the Queen. And we hear from Sentayehu Eshetu, who has coached more than a dozen Olympic medallists and world record-holders all from one small Ethiopian town. Image: Pak Asif Credit: Rebecca Henschke Show less
