Chinese and African trade has been aggressively courted. It has now crossed the $300 billion mark and continues to grow particularly in Kenya. Along with the investment, 10,000 Chinese have come to Kenya to live and work. But, how are they interacting with Kenyans? Linda Yueh visits Kenya to look past the economic headlines and instead discover the social conundrums that Chinese investment in Africa has brought about. She hears stories of physical fights between Chinese workers and local Kenyan tribes, speaks to the Chinese who have set up shop in Kenya, and discovers stories of legitimate and the illegitimate relationships between Chinese and Kenyans that are taking place.
