Matthew Parris finds out why the actor Bill Paterson would nominate for Great Life status a Scottish actor little known outside Scotland. He is Leonard Maguire, who died in 1997 after a career which took in acting on stage, television, film and radio and included some wonderful writing - not bad going for a man who learned English as his third language as a child. The expert witness is Leonard Maguire's writer daughter, Susie. Produced by Christine Hall and Sarah Langan. First heard on Radio 4 in 2012. Show less
