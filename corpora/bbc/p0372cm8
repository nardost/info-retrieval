Until recently it was a serious offence for people to gather in groups on the streets of Myanmar. But things are changing. Each week, punk musician Kyaw Kyaw, along with his band mates, friends and supporters, distribute food to people living on the streets of Yangon. They are the Burmese chapter of Food not Bombs - an anti-poverty initiative that began in the United States in the 1980s. The Hawaiian Japanese ukulele player Jake Shimabukuro shot to international fame when his cover of the George Harrison song While My Guitar Gently Weeps went viral on YouTube - getting 14 million hits. Yet just 10 years before, he had dropped out of school and in the darker moments of his life, he says the instrument saved him. He is now acclaimed for playing jazz, funk, rock and even classical music on the ukulele - and is about to release his new album. The Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo is home to over 200 mountain gorillas as well as countless other wildlife. The rangers who patrol it have a challenging job - dealing with unpredictable animals and violent threats from poachers. Until recently, all the rangers were men. But now these sought after jobs have also been taken by women. Francine Bwizabule Muhimuzi was one of the first women to pass the rigorous selection process - she tells Outlook why she wanted to become a park ranger. And, we meet the one-legged dancer who became a sensation on the TV show India's Got Talent. When she was growing up in the Indian state of Punjab, Subhreet Kaur Ghumman loved to dance. But she was not confident enough to think of becoming a professional. Instead, she followed her family's wishes and signed up to train as a nurse. In the first week of her training, she was involved in an accident that changed her life forever. (Picture credit: Ali Fowle) Show less
