Balezi Bagunda is known as Kibomango and his first love is boxing, but a lack of career options in the Democratic Republic of Congo meant that he became a soldier at 17. But when the government was overthrown in a coup, Balezi found himself destitute and forced into hiding. He tells Emily Webb how he went from sleeping in a football stadium to creating a boxing club inside that stadium for other people who are looked at as outcasts. Here’s a question I bet you’ve never asked yourself: what music did Jesus like? Well it’s a question that British composer MaryAnn Tedstone has certainly thought about. And that's because no one really knows. The music of the Roman Empire has been a mystery…until now. MaryAnn has spent years figuring out what music of the Roman era sounded like - and in a world first, you can hear it on Outlook. "Serial killer" is a term we're all familiar with and former FBI agent John E Douglas helped to think up that phrase. Through his job, John spent years getting into the minds of some of the most notorious murderers in American history so he could build a profile of them. This involved listening patiently as they recounted in explicit detail every horrific moment of their crimes. John told Outlook's Andrea Kennedy what it was like, and be warned, some of the descriptions are disturbing. (Image: Young people training at a boxing club in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
