When Gail Lukasik was growing up in the US, she'd always wondered about her mother's quirky habits. For instance, she always wore a light foundation before she went to bed. Years later Gail would discover that this had been one of her mother's attempt to hide the fact that she was actually multiracial and had passed as white her whole life. Gail spoke to Outlookâ€™s Emily Webb about why her mother had tried so hard to hide the truth from her family. Herbert Nitsch is a free diver, meaning he dives without breathing equipment.
