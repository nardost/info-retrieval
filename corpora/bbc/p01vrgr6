‘Good Evening Cape Town! Are you ready for Blacks Only?’ It’s the start of another of the ironically titled comedy shows which have showcased South Africa’s new generation of Black comedians. Under apartheid, stand-up comedy was exclusively the domain of white performers. "They say tragedy plus time equals comedy," says South African comedian Riaad Moosa. "Comedy is a way to heal the wounds and you can laugh about something because at its core, comedy is about survival." Under apartheid, stand-up comedy was exclusively the domain of white performers. But now comics like David Kau and Riaad Moosa are challenging that dominance with their witty takes on the complexities and divides of their society. Reporter Tamanna Rahman asks if comedy is challenging the continuing legacy of inequality – or reinforcing it.
