Obama's First Year One year on from Obama's inauguration Matthew Bannister speaks to Tanya Fields, a single mum and community activist from one of America's poorest neighbourhoods, the South Bronx. She gives her verdict on the president's first year in office and tells us about the momentous changes that have taken place in her own life over the past twelve months. Cold and homeless in India Homeless people in Delhi are experiencing a tough winter. Not only have temperatures fallen dramatically below the seasonal average, but a number of shelters have been closed down in an attempt to spruce the city up for the Commonwealth games, which will be held there later this year. A number of deaths have been recorded and the BBC's Gayathri Sreedharan has been to meet those effected. Sleep Talking Matthew Bannister gets an insight to the night time persona of sleep talking internet sensation Adam Lennard. Adam became an online hit when his wife, Karen, recorded his ramblings whilst he was asleep. Ambreen Sadiq Britain's only female, Muslim boxer, Ambreen Sadiq, tells Matthew Bannister about her fights both inside and outside of the ring. When she puts on her gloves Ambreen's not just trying to beat down her opponent, but battling against cultural disapproval. She is also joined in the studio by her number one fan, her proud mother Carla, who describes the emotions she feels when she watches her daughter box. "Ambreen the girl boxer" can be seen in the UK this Friday on Channel 4 TV. Show less
