Former commander of the British and Coalition forces in Helmand province Major General Andrew Mackay, embarks on a personal journey to find out what has been achieved by the 14-year-campaign in Afghanistan. He puts searching questions to former US General David Petraeus, International Security Assistance Force commanders General John McColl and General David Richards, to discover if there ever was a coherent strategy for coalition troops. He reflects on what was achieved in Afghanistan with former US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and former UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband. And, he looks to the future of the country with a senior figure from the current Afghan government - Mohammad Mustafa Mastoor, Deputy Minister for Finance. He also believes that any future interventions should be based on lessons learned in the Afghanistan campaign. But what are those lessons? He hears from experts who have studied the campaign to help him consider the role he played and whether the campaign was worthwhile.
