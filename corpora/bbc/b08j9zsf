George Saunders, Kirsty Logan, Jenn Asworth and Paul McVeigh discuss writing fiction short and long with presenter Matthew Sweet. Acclaimed American short story writer George Saunders talks about travelling in time to explore Abraham Lincoln's life during the American Civil War when the President's beloved young son died. These historical events have inspired Saunder's first novel, Lincoln in the Bardo, whilst his short fiction has appeared in The New Yorker, Harper's, McSweeeney's and GQ. He compares notes on the art of the short story with Paul McVeigh, Jenn Ashworth and Kirsty Logan, who've been commissioned by New Writing North and the WordFactory to write Flash Fiction on this year's Free Thinking Festival theme of The Speed of Life.
