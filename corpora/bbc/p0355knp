After his brother was killed in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing Ken Dornstein has spent years trying to find out who was behind the attack . Now, through his work as a documentary film maker, he has uncovered evidence that has led to the naming of a new suspect in the investigation. For 30 years, the British double bassist Chi-chi Nwanoku has enjoyed a successful career as a classical musician. Chi Chi, who has Nigerian and Irish parents, is the musical director and founder of Europe's first professional wholly non-white orchestra which she founded to increase diversity in classical music In 1962, Satish Kumar heard that the British philosopher Bertrand Russell had been arrested for protesting nuclear weapons. In response, Satish and his friend Prabhakar Menon decided to set out on an 8000 mile journey to meet the leaders of the then four major nuclear powers to convince them to get rid of their arms, on foot, with no passport and no money. Many of us have been moved by stories of the plight of migrants at sea, but Ben Board, who works for a marine salvage company in England decided to do something to help. He and his colleagues used their knowledge of the sea to invent what Ben has called the Centifloat. It's basically a giant inflatable tube that can be thrown from a ship to help a group of migrants. In just a few months, the invention has gone from idea to reality. Picture: Ken Dornstein Picture credit: Frontline PBS Show less
