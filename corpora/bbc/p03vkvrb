Fatma and Mashal are twin baby girls from Pakistan's Swat Valley who were born joined together at the abdomen. Their father Nisar Ghani could not afford surgery to separate them but, with the help of paediatric surgeon Dr Amjad Choudhry, managed to find a potential lifeline for his daughters. New Zealander Nigel Watson is part of what's been described as the world's most extreme conservation project. He's working to preserve the 100-year old wooden huts used by legendary explorers Shackleton and Scott in Antarctica. And Hollywood star Tom Hanks discusses his latest film - one man's attempt to make a deal with a wealthy monarch in Saudi Arabia. Photo: Nisar Ghani with his twin daughters Fatma and Mashal. Show less
