Matthew Bannister on Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees who, with his brothers Barry and Maurice, created scores of hit records. We hear about his rivalry with Barry for the lead vocal spot and his obsession with the Titanic. Also: the left wing Anglican Canon Eric James, a regular on Radio 4's Thought For The Day, Alan Oakley who invented the Chopper bicycle, much coveted by schoolboys of the seventies, David Ellis - the dancer and doctor who married into the Ballet Rambert and played a leading role in the company's development. And Eugene Polley who launched a million couch potatoes by pioneering the TV remote control. Elvis McGonagall pays tribute in verse from his sofa. Show less
