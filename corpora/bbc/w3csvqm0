Can you imagine what it would do to you to feel responsible for someone's death? When Maryann Gray was 22 she was out driving through a small town in Ohio. It was 1977, Maryann had driven the route many times before but on the 15th of June a young boy ran into the path of her car and was killed. It was a complete accident, she had no legal responsibility for the death and there was nothing Maryann could have done to prevent it but that one moment and the guilt and the trauma attached to it has stayed with her ever since. She has now set up a website called Accidental Impacts helping other people who are coping with causing a serious accident. Image and credit: Maryann Gray Show less
