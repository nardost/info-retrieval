Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, Matthew Bannister talks to the 26 year old Tibetan, Sherab Tsedor who set himself on fire in front of the Chinese Embassy in Delhi. We also hear from Christian Bethelson, the former Liberian soldier who is now working for peace and reconciliation in his homeland.

Sarah has a heart rhythm disorder which led to her needing an implanted defibrillator - a small device which delivers an electric shock to the heart when an abnormal rhythm is detected. Show less
