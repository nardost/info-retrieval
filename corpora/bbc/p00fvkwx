AN ACCIDENTAL SURROGATE When Sean and Carolyn Savage went for fertility treatment they were hoping to add a much wanted fourth child to their family. But a mistake at the IVF clinic left the couple with a nightmare. The wrong embryos had been implanted so Carolyn was told she was carrying another woman's child. The Savages faced a terrible dilemma - should they continue with the pregnancy and then hand the child over to its natural parents or should they undergo a termination?
