Jo Fidgen takes Outlook to Haiti to meet some of the extraordinary people who are helping their country recover from natural disasters and political instability. Daniel Tillias grew up in a shanty town in Haiti that had a bad reputation for violence and poverty. Cite Soleil was once described as the most dangerous place in the world, but Daniel's trying to transform his neighbourhood through his community project Sakala. He has built a garden called Jaden Tap Tap. It's set on an acre of land on a former rubbish dump and grows trees, plants and vegetables, as well as training local people to produce their own food. Jo also meets one of the young gardeners, Yvenine Luc, who is trying to make a difference here. Image: Daniel Tillias in his garden in Cite Soleil Credit: n/a Show less
