This week's Forum comes from London's only lighthouse, on the banks of the river Thames and right opposite one of the Olympic venues. With the world's eyes focused on London over the course of the next month, and with so many people travelling to the UK capital, the lighthouse is the perfect place to explore the concept of navigation. Bridget Kendall is joined by Nick Ward, the Research Director of the General Lighthouse Authorities of the UK and Ireland, an organisation that has been looking after lighthouses and other navigational aids for 500 years; Margarette Lincoln, Deputy Director at the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich; and Andrei Kurkov, a Ukrainian writer who divides his time between the capital Kiev, with its majestic Dnieper river, and London.
