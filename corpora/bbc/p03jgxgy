Determination: Stories of people who have kept aiming for their goal, no matter who, or what might be standing in their way. Dr Jane Goodall. She's now famous for her pioneering work with chimpanzees. When she was in her twenties, more than half a century ago, Jane first set foot in Gombe, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania. It was there she first observed chimpanzees making tools. But, the road to her discoveries wasn't straightforward. Asif Mohiuddin is an atheist in the majority Muslim country of Bangladesh. Years ago he decided to start a blog, to share his secular views, but his writing made him a target, and he started receiving daily threats from those who were offended by his articles. Then, in 2013, he was attacked by a group of radical Islamists. The birth of a baby should be a time for celebration - but in parts of India parents are devastated if their new child is a girl. Some even decide to terminate the pregnancy if a sex screening test shows the baby is female. Dr Ganesh Rakh is determined to change those attitudes. Nigerian forensic pathologist Bennet Omalu thought he's discovered a new disease that was affecting American Football. He had an idea that repeated collisions in the sport could mean players suffer the same kind of brain injuries as boxers, trouble was, no-one believed him. (L) Dr Jane Goodall.
