A new history of ideas presented by Melvyn Bragg, but told in many voices. Each week Melvyn is joined by four guests with different backgrounds to discuss a really big question. This week they're tackling the question 'What does it mean to be me?'. Helping him answer it are the writer A. L. Kennedy, the neuropsychologist Paul Broks, the philosopher Jules Evans, and the ontologist Barry Smith. Between them they will investigate consciousness, delve into memory, examine ideas about the 'self' and veer into existentialism. Then each of them attempt to take us further into the subject, with programmes of their own. This Omnibus edition has all five programmes together. Show less
