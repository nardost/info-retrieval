One boat, two families; trying to escape war in Syria, desperate to start a new life in Europe. In October 2013, dozens of migrants aboard that boat died, as it travelled across the Mediterranean Sea. But some eventually made it to Malta. That was a year ago. And this is the story of what happened then and what happened next. Presenter: Nuala McGovern.
