Surviving Niagara As a seven year old, Roger Woodward was swept over the Niagara Falls, located between Canada and the United States. Fifty years on, he tells us what happened when he, his sister and a family friend were thrown into the river after a boating accident, not far from the brink. He went over, falling one-hundred-and-sixty two feet, but miraculously lived to tell the tale. Life in Britain for Karen refugees Several refugee families from Burma's Karen community are starting new lives in the city of Sheffield in the north of England. They were relocated from Thailand under a UN scheme, and a documentary called "Moving to Mars" follows two families during their first year. Director Matt Whitecross tells Outlook their stories.
