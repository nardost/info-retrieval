This year's Reith lecturer is the Booker prize-nominated author Marina Warner. A writer of fiction, criticism and history, her works include novels and short stories as well as studies of art, myths, symbols, and fairytales. Her series of Reith Lectures, entitled 'Managing Monsters', explores how myths express and shape our attitudes. In her second lecture, Marina Warner examines the threads linking ancient myths and modern machismo and argues that ideas about masculinity are not naturally inculcated. Does the warrior ethic fit the needs of our civil society? Why does an age which believes in medical and scientific intervention, co-exist with a determinist philosophy about human nature and gender?
