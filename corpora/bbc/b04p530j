Matthew Sweet talks to playwright David Greig and actor Siobhan Redmond about their approaches to drama. How much do you have to know about the characters and the story before you begin? How has theatre contributed to the recent discussions about Scottish identity ? David Greig, the National Theatre of Scotland's first Dramaturg, is one of our leading playwrights whose work has been produced around the world, including Dunsinane, his sequel to Macbeth, The Events, written after the Breivik massacre in Norway; Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and his Yes/No plays on Twitter before the Scottish referendum. Siobhan Redmond has worked in theatre, television and radio including work for the RSC, National Theatre of Scotland and Renaissance Theatre Company. She played the role of Gruach (Lady Macbeth) in Greig's Dunsinane. Recorded in front of audiences at the BBC Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival of Ideas at Sage Gateshead. The festival theme this year is The Limits of Knowledge. All the discussions and essays from the Free Thinking festival are available as Radio 3 Arts and Ideas downloads. Producer: Fiona McLean.
