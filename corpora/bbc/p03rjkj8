Farhana Haider enters the world of Duaripara slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh to meet a group of teenage girls who were married and then abandoned by their husbands before they even reached the age of 16. While in the globalized world of opportunity, many of us are discovering and shaping our identities through new possibilities, others less fortunate are having their identities shaped by circumstances out of their control. Are the identities of these girls now fixed for the rest of their lives? What chances do they have to define who are they are? How does the tight-knit slum community hinder or help shape the girls' futures? For the BBC World Service Identity season, Farhana hears them give intimate insights into who they are and what they think the future holds.
