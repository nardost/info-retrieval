Ugandan Tumusiime Henry was just 15 when he was accused of two murders and held without trial. He remained in detention for almost two years until an American lawyer, Jim Gash took up his case and helped acquit him. Ellie Crossley was 11 when she was attacked and gored by a stag that had got into her family's garden on the south coast of England. That could have put her off wild animals for life, but last year she took up a job looking after the only remaining herd of wild cattle left in Britain. The US blues guitarist and singer, Bonnie Raitt, has been called one of the finest guitar players in the world and has won 10 Grammys over her 45-year career. She told Jenni Murray why the instrument has appealed to her for so long. (Photo: Tumusiime Henry (L) and Jim Gash (R). Credit: Divine Collision) Show less
