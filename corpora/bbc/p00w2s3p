After a broken relationship, record collector Joe Fletcher finds solace in vinyl, in America's Deep South. This series paints a portrait of the American South where a few decades ago, anyone could make their mark on posterity by paying a few hundred dollars to produce a vinyl record. Writer and DJ and Joe Fletcher has amassed thousands of these largely religious records. He takes a trip along the back roads of the Deep South - tracking down the people who recorded records up to 50 years ago - to see how their lives have developed. In this three-part series Joe meets a cast of real-life characters who reflect on their achievements and failures, and the reality of the American dream. In Georgia, Johnny 'Hurricane' Jones, a preacher who began recording his sermons half a century ago, looks back on an energetic career. From small beginnings, his congregation grew to several thousand, before a fire destroyed his church and he had to begin again. In Oklahoma, Joe hears from Paul Anderson, who recorded an anti-evolution rock 'n' roll song in the 1970s. All he ever wanted was to find true love which, after several decades searching, he has finally achieved. Joe also speaks to Little Jan Buckner, a glamorous gospel singer with a lively sense of humour and the voice of an angel. Jan began her career singing with a Southern gospel trio called Wendy Bagwell and the Sunliters. Still singing and touring after more than 50 years, Little Jan recounts how she battled on and began a new solo career in spite of the death of her lead singer. Southern Tracks is a look at the alternative side of the United Sates. Meeting these artists sheds light on values in the American South today and asks if the American dream is still alive and well.
