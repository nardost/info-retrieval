In May 2019 Saray Khumalo became the first black African woman to summit Everest. She defied those who didn't believe she could achieve her dream of climbing the worldâ€™s highest peaks. The trek to the top wasn't easy though, Saray tells Andile Masuku about three previous attempts and her near-death experiences. Saray's adventurous expeditions help raise money to educate young Africans through a charity she's set up called Summits With a Purpose.
