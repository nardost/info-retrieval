Why is it that some parts of the world encourage differing views, while others find them rude or even dangerous?

Quentin Cooper discusses ways of managing disagreement with global business guru Erin Meyer, graffiti artist Bahia Shehab, and sociologist John Hall. (Photo: Two people shouting at each other.
