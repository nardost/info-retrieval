Wild elephants surround a village in Assam, India. And they're hungry. They have been forced off their usual feeding routes, and Damon Smith goes out with the night watch to find out where the homeless elephants go. Hosted by Academy award-winning documentary film-maker Asif Kapadia (Amy, Senna, Diego Maradona), this is the second episode of a five-part series from BBC World Service in collaboration with Robert Redfordâ€™s Sundance Institute.
