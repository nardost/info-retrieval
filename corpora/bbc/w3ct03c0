For artist Kim Lynch, God Only Knows is a song that she has carried with her from the moment her father played it to her mother back in their 1960s London home and it is the song that resonated throughout her parents 65 years together. Meanwhile in land locked Burundi, another couple are bought together from two very different cultures. Sharing the same hopes and prayers, they began their married life by blending a traditional wedding ceremony with the Californian song that spans decades - and continents - to touch souls wherever it is played. And across the ocean, Erin Prewitt tells her love story and describes how tragic and unexpected circumstances meant she has had to learn to live out those iconic lyrics and discover what it means to be without the person you love. With reflections from musician Al Kooper and author Barry Miles. (Photo: The Beach Boys at the Finsbury Astoria.
