At 15, Cherno Samba was a footballing wonderkid, fought over by the biggest clubs in the world. He played for England’s under-17s but when a deal with Liverpool fell through his career stalled. Cherno continued to play but meanwhile, on a popular football computer game his character was becoming a legend. Have you ever thought about how much you use your sense of smell in a day? For some people, this doesn’t happen. That can be because of a condition called anosmia, where the sense of smell is limited or cut off completely. Stephanie Feuer lives in New York City.

In the late 1990s, lawyer Jacqueline Moudeina took on one of the most important cases in African legal history – the trial of Chad's former dictator Hissène Habré. He's a man who had massacred and tortured his people, including members of Jacqueline’s own family. She was determined to get justice, even if it took decades and meant risking her life.
