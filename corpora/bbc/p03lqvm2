The albino journalist Stéphane Ebongue was forced to leave his native Cameroon when a volcano erupted. There is a traditional belief that only the blood of an albino can appease the volcano, and Stephane feared for his life. He has since returned to his homeland to confront a witchdoctor who uses albino body parts in his potions. Yasmin Whittaker-Khan is a British playwright whose new play, Porcelain Dolls, was inspired by her childhood living with an abusive family. For centuries Christians and Muslims have visited the small Syrian town of al-Qaryatain to venerate a saint known as Mar Elian. But in August last year the shrine was bulldozed by IS, and the multi-faith community that had grown up around the monastery was torn apart. Samuel Kapepo had a tough time growing up in a poor neighbourhood in the north of Namibia and fell in with a bad crowd. But he found an unusual way out of the rut he was in - acting. He has now turned his life around, and helps others in his community. (Picture: Stéphane Ebongue. Photo: Smart Factory.) Show less
