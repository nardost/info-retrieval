Geraint Anderson, who worked as an investment banker for 12 years, explains why he walked away from the London trading floor and his glitzy lifestyle because he felt he had sold his soul to the devil. He also explains his decision to expose the world of traders in an anonymous newspaper column. Also, we visit the monthly drag queen show in Ulan Bator, Mongolia, to hear one transgender man's story. And we meet James Balog, the American photographer on a mission to record the world's disappearing glaciers. Image: London skyline by Phil Coomes Show less
