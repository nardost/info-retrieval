Jill Heinerth explored the submerged caves and crevasses of an enormous iceberg. There was an incredible array of wildlife to document, but the dive was extremely risky. Jill spoke to Outlook's Jo Fidgen. Thomas Quick was once one of Sweden’s most notorious serial killers. He was convicted of eight murders, although he'd confessed to many more. Then, almost two decades later, he retracted his confessions and said he was innocent. Jenny Küttim is a Swedish journalist who has been covering the case since 2008 and Björn Asplund is the father of Johan Asplund, the first person Thomas Quick confessed to killing. They spoke to Outlook's Asya Fouks. Picture: Diver Jill Heinerth explores an iceberg Credit: Jill Heinerth Show less
