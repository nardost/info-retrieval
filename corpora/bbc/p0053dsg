Mr Wang Wang Zhiqui is the Director of the China International Search & Rescue Team. He's risked his own life to help others caught up in the aftermath of natural disasters such as the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the Sichuan earthquake in China in 2008. He describes the devastation he's seen and tells us why keeping a diary is so important to him. New York Princess It's not easy finding someone to spend the rest of your life with as British journalist Tim Samuels well knows. He sensed time might be running out for him when he went to the weddings of seven friends in seven weeks and so set himself the challenge of finding a bride in just one week. Being Jewish, Tim wanted to find a partner of the same faith, so he set off for New York to try out the city's celebrated Jewish dating scene. White Witch & The Black Mamba Thea Litscha Koen is known by some people in Swaziland as a white witch - a woman with a unique skill. She captures snakes, particularly very poisonous ones, and rescues them. She's particularly good at catching the Black Mamba - a snake that can grow to 13 feet long. The bite of the Black Mamba is known as the 'kiss of death' because without very swift medical treatment, the mortality rate is 100%. She explains how she goes about her work, and the respect she has for this deadly snake. Show less
