The amazing shapes of plants and flowers, one of nature’s biggest mysteries: why are they so varied and beautiful? Joining Bridget Kendall are Enrico Coen, who has been making exciting discoveries about how small buds transform themselves into remarkably complex leaves and flowers; Andrew Zuckerman, who explains his quest to capture the essence of a flower’s shape in a single photograph; and Lars Chittka, who invites us to look at flowers through the eyes of bees and other pollinating insects.
