In June 2010 Julia Gillard became Australia's first woman Prime Minister. She tells Matthew about the tumultuous three years she spent in office, the famous speech she gave to the Australian parliament accusing the then leader of the opposition of sexism, and what she misses most about being Prime Minister. Her autobiography is called My Story. Would you give up a six figure salary to become a human cannonball? That's what British man Gary Stocker did two years ago when he quit his well-paid job as a lawyer to invest in a circus and become the star performer. He tells Matthew why he did it. The American sculptor Ursula Von Rydingsvard makes monumental artworks, constructed from huge planks of cedar wood which she saws and chisels into shape. But after thirty five years of working with cedar wood she's become allergic to it and needs to wear a protective suit while she sculpts. Reporter Andrew Purcell went to meet her in her New York studio . (Picture: Julia Gillard. Credit:Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images) Show less
