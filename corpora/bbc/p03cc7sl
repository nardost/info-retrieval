The Dhnie family thought risking their lives at sea in order to get to Greece would be the hardest part of their journey to Europe. They soon changed their minds. The family find themselves sleeping on streets and in fields, getting caught up in riots and being detained as they try to reach a new life in Europe. We've heard the news of migrants drowning, of queues at borders and reception centres but, in a short news report, it's impossible to capture the detail of the journey hundreds of thousands of Syrians have made. The nights spent sleeping rough, running out of money and the nagging questionâ€¦is it worth it? For five weeks this year reporter Manveen Rana travelled with one Syrian family. A New Life in Europe is an intimate account of that journey as it gets tougher and the family begin to doubt they have made the right decision. Image: The Dhnie family Credit: Manveen Rana Show less
