Pablo Escobar was one of the most notorious criminals of the 20th century. The Colombian drug baron controlled 80% of the global cocaine trade in the 1980s and was linked to the deaths of thousands of people, including hundreds of police officers. There was a huge operation to hunt him down and Colombia asked the US Drug Enforcement Administration to help. We meet the two DEA agents who were involved - Steve Murphy and Javier Pena. Their stories feature in the popular TV show, Narcos. In March 2011, a massive earthquake and tsunami caused devastation in Japan. Nineteen thousand people were killed and another two and a half thousand are missing -- including four hundred and twenty-one people from the town of Otsuchi. There, many people are still struggling with their losses. So one resident, Itaru Sasaki, has installed a phone box in his garden where relatives can come and have imaginary conversations with their loved ones. Outlook's Alessia Cerantola paid a visit to the booth. Vanessa Toulmin is from a long line of English fairground people, she grew up with the fair as part of her life, but she chose a very different path in life. She's now a professor at Sheffield University in the UK and has set up the National Fairground and Circus Archive. She tells Jo Fidgen about her life, growing up with the fair.
