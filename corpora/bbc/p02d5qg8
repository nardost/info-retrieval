Neryl Joyce resigned from her job as a soldier the Australian army ten years ago. She was a single mum with a young son, but she didn't turn her back on danger. She chose a surprising new career - working as a private bodyguard in war-torn Baghdad. Today she calls herself the "Mercenary Mum". Neryl's first role was guarding members of Iraq's electoral commission, a key target for insurgents. French DJ and music producer David Guetta is one of the biggest names in pop music - he's had successful collaborations with high profile artists like Rihanna, Usher and The Black Eyed Peas. David has the jet set lifestyle of an international dance music DJ and his videos feature fast cars and scantily clad women. But since the recent break up of his twenty year marriage, he's revealed a more introspective side, which is shown by his latest and much more personal album "Listen". Drag queen Asifa Lahore has long curly black hair and wears flamboyant dresses - she is hoping to be Britain's entry in next year's Eurovision Song Contest. But the man behind the glam persona - Asif Quraishi - grew up in a conservative Muslim family in a large south Asian community in west London. Asif's journey to becoming Asifa started the day he told his Pakistani parents that he was gay. 27 year old Maurice Oniang'o from Kenya has just beaten one hundred journalists from around the world to win a top award.
