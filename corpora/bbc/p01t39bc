A decision by his father to send him to ballet school changed the direction of Carlos Acosta’s life. Thanks to Fidel Castro’s belief that art should be accessible to all Cubans he received free ballet tuition. It shaped his character, and secured his future. Now he wants to give something back to his country by saving an abandoned ballet school in Havana. Vittorio Garatti’s School of Ballet is an extraordinary labyrinth of corridors, graceful arches and majestic brick and terracotta domes, and has been described as one of the most remarkable buildings of the 20th Century. But the ballet star’s attempts to restore the building have stirred Latin passions and protest. In, Will Carlos Acosta Get to the Pointe, Acosta travels back to his native Cuba with producer, Cecile Wright, to report on his bid to save the school, and in exploring the importance of music and dance to Cuba’s national identity, he examines what the fate of the ballet school symbolises about the country’s artistic legacy.
