Syria's healthcare system has "entirely collapsed" according to the recent Medecin Sans Frontiers report, with doctors, clinics and hospitals targeted as a tactic of war. Matthew Bannister hears from a doctor working in makeshift secret hospitals to treat the wounded, and about his nightmares of being caught. He also speaks to the British Syrian emergency doctor who's been smuggling in much needed medical supplies to help the medics. And as David Bowie fever sweeps the West, we hear again from the Japanese stylist behind his best known character - Ziggy Stardust. Yacco Takahashi is an iconic figure in her own right, becoming Japan's first professional stylist in the 1970s. Yacco is now in her 70s and has extraordinary memories of working with major international stars. Picture: Makeshift surgery set up in a private house in Syria.
