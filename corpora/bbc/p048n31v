Earlier this year Geraldine Roman became the first openly transgender elected politician in the Philippines. It's a conservative Catholic country, but Geraldine won by a landslide in her home province of Bataan where her family has long been one of the leading political dynasties. She tells reporter Aurora Almendral her story. When renowned British children's writer Mal Peet died suddenly from cancer at the age of 67 he left behind an unfinished manuscript called "Beck". His friend - the American-born writer Meg Rosoff - agreed to take on the challenging task of completing the book. It's a coming of age story about a mixed race orphan boy set in Canada in the 1900s. Meg tells Matthew Bannister about her friendship with Mal. Izzati and Atiqah Khairudin are Malaysia's first female hot air balloonists - they're also sisters and there was a bit of sibling rivalry as to who would claim the title first. Their father was also a ballooning pioneer - he was one of the first pilots in the country and would stage a hugely popular ballooning fiesta every year. The sisters are currently in the middle of a balloon tour of the Malaysian peninsula and Matthew Bannister caught up with them during a pit stop in Kuala Lumpur. (Photo: Geraldine Roman.
