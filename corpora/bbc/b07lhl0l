Matthew Bannister on Thomas Sutherland the Scottish-born American professor who was held hostage for more than six years in Lebanon. We hear from his fellow hostage Terry Anderson. The singer, songwriter and producer Gary S Paxton. He brought us the Monster Mash and thousands of other songs and lived up to his nickname "His Weirdness" Sally Beauman, who was given a reported million pound advance for her best selling novel Destiny, but transcended the bonk buster genre. Frank Dickens, the cartoonist who satirised office life in the Bristow comic strip and often liked to strip naked himself. And Marni Nixon, whose singing voice was dubbed over Hollywood movie stars when they couldn't hit the high notes. Producer: Paul Waters. Show less
