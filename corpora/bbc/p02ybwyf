Is grief a uniquely human condition or do animals also feel similar emotions? Bridget Kendall and guests explore how universal the grieving process may be, comparing rituals among Catholics in Portugal and Ireland to the Hindu rituals in India. Susan Moreira Marques is an award winning Portuguese journalist and writer, Bharati Mukherjee is an Indian born author and academic and Barbara J King is an American anthropologist who investigates the links between primate behaviour and human development.
