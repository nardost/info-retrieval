Under Silvio Berlusconi the arts in Rome suffered. Add widespread racism to an escalating immigration problem, and the chances of thriving as immigrant and artist in Italy are slim. So when a multi-ethnic orchestra sprang into being in 2002 it hit the headlines. This is the extraordinary story of the Orchestra di Piazza Vittorio. Conductor Mario Tronco arrived in Rome from Sicily in 2002 and was immediately fascinated by the multi-ethnic Piazza Vittorio in the heart of the historical Esquiline district. Fascinated by the sounds and languages that, like music, rise through the courtyards outside his windows he dreamed of having an orchestra which would bring together all these sounds. Amanda Hargreaves hears the story of how he scoured the streets of the city searching for musicians born somewhere abroad and brought to Rome by destiny. He succeeded in banding together 20 members, each one unique in origin, instrument and musical experience. Their first concert revealed their extraordinary energy and creativity in reinventing music from all over the world. Thirteen years on from their first performance we hear the stories of individual musicians with insights into life as an immigrant in Italy. Today the Orchestra di Piazza Vittorio is a shining example of what can be produced by a group of hugely disparate people who have learned to work and live together and most importantly to pool their talent to create something exciting and new. In addition to the performances and voices of the members of the Orchestra di Piazza Vittorio interviewed for the programme we also hear vocal performances by Mama Marjias (in the role of Carmen), Evandro Dos Ries (Don José), Houcine Ataa (Escamillo), and Elsa Birgò (Micaela).
