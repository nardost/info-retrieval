As political deadlock in Ukraine erupts into violence on the streets of Kiev, Anne McElvoy investigates whether there are deep historical and cultural roots of the conflict, and considers possible consequences for the international community, with Ukrainian novelist Anna Shevchenko and journalist Edward Lucas. And as the start of the Sochi Winter Olympics approaches, Anne investigates the state of dissent in Russia today with novelist Boris Akunin, who's played a leading role in protests against Putin, Masha Gessen, author of 'The Passion of Pussy Riot' and Marc Bennetts, whose book 'Kicking The Kremlin' examines the political and social opposition to Putin.
