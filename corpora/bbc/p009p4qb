Chess is an ancient game that has been widely popular for centuries â€“ but how is it faring in modern times? Simon Terrington, a self-confessed chess fanatic, explores the game in today's world. Is modern technology changing it and how it's played? In a world where there are more and more calls upon our time, do people still wish to devote hours to mastering it? Simon reaffirms his love for chess by absorbing the passion it generates, from grandmasters to community club players; from the World Chess Championship to the chess boards of a Bulgarian park. These programmes build a new picture of a game: a game with a wealth of beneficial attributes, but also one with a pugilistic, addictive hook that keeps players coming back to the board, again and again. Simon examines the continuing allure of chess. He revisits the Macclesfield Chess Club in the north of England where he played as a ten-year-old. Simon also speaks to a wide range of chess experts like grandmaster Anatoly Karpov, Amon Simotowe, the first Zambian grandmaster and former women's world champion Antoinette Stefanova who describes chess as a "form of meditation".
