In episode one, immerse yourself in Pieter Bruegel the Elder's masterpiece The Harvesters. Follow the link to explore the picture and you'll be able to zoom in and see the tiniest details as you listen. It is a hot, dry day in 16th Century Flanders. Labourers grab a break from bringing in the harvest; they eat lunch and snooze under a tree. Behind them, the peaceful countryside is full of life. Scrumpers steal from an orchard, villagers enjoy harvest games on the green, monks escape the heat with a wild-swim. Cathy FitzGerald takes a walk through the landscape and then hears how the masterpiece may have brightened up a wealthy Antwerp merchant's dinner parties.
