The historian David Christian looks at the birth and development of the universe. He weaves together science, arts and humanities in his vast tale of human existence. Emily Wilson is the first woman to translate, The Odyssey, the great adventure story of classical literature. The historian Antony Beevor reconstructs the tragedy of Arnhem, the Battle for the Bridges in 1944. He questions whether the British military strategy was doomed from the start. Success and failure are woven through Dr Jonathan D Quick's study of epidemics. He asks whether politics and science can come together to prevent the deaths of millions of people.
