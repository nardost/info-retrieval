Is it in some way easier to live in a more polarised society? Do the people of Northern Ireland still harbour a soft spot for the hard men? At a time of increased tensions in the area, a panel of celebrated citizens of Northern Ireland debate this in front of an audience at the Northern Ireland National Assembly in Stormont. The discussion kicks off with a performance by the award-winning poet Paul Muldoon from his latest collection. Joining Paul on the panel is Baroness May Blood of Blackwatertown, MBE, a campaigner for integrated education and Dr Raman Kapur a consultant clinical psychologist in Belfast. Award winning poet, Paul Muldoon, has been described as the most significant English-language poet born since the Second World War. Paul is currently a professor at Princeton University. Baroness May Blood of Blackwatertown, MBE, was born and raised in Belfast and worked in a linen mill from her teenage years. She has fought for equality for women at work and was the first woman in Northern Ireland to be given a life peerage. Dr Raman Kapur is a Consultant Clinical Psychologist and Chief Executive of Threshold, a mental health charity in Northern Ireland who has written and researched on 'The Troubled Mind of Northern Ireland'.
