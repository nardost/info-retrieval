In 1994, at the height of the civil war in Somalia, Murayo Torregrossa became separated from her family. She was adopted by an Italian soldier. But her birth father, Mahad Mohamed Aden, never stopped looking for her. Fourteen years later, he managed to trace her, and they were later reunited. The self-proclaimed cycling superhero - Lewis Dediare AKA Traffic Droid - freewheels around London on his bike and tries to make the streets safer for other cyclists. He films every journey he makes and reports motorists driving badly to the police. Elvira Dones is an Albanian novelist and documentary film-maker. She defected from the Communist regime in 1988 and now lives in the USA. Her most recent novel, Sworn Virgins, explores the unusual custom for women in some remote parts of Albania to live as men, in exchange for remaining virgins. Genesis Lubiana lives in a slum in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. He has made money picking through rubbish dumps and from stealing, which caused him to spend time in jail. Almost 10 years ago, when he was particularly desperate for cash, he went to hospital and sold one of his kidneys for $3,000 - something he now deeply regrets. Our reporter Candida Beveridge went to meet him. The Kenyan national football team did not qualify for the World Cup finals in Brazil. But, as the tournament gets underway, Kenya will be represented on the pitch. A chemistry and maths teacher called Aden Marwa Range will be taking part as an assistant referee - and he will be the only Kenyan involved in the competition.
