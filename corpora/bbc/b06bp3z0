Cross class marriage: Laurie Taylor talks to Jessi Streib, Assistant Professor of Sociology at Duke University, US, about her study into the lives of people who married a partner raised in a social class very different from their own. Do spouses from blue collar backgrounds take a laissez faire approach to daily life? Are those from white collar, professional families likely to want to take organisational control? They're joined by Mary Evans, Centennial Professor at the Gender Institute at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Also, the social history of women only train carriages: did they promote safety or inequality? Producer: Jayne Egerton. Show less
