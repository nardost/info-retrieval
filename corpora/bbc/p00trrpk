When London won the Olympics in 2005, it was with a promise that London 2012 would be the "greenest Olympics ever". But how green can the Olympics really be? It's an event which involves building a huge new sports complex in a different city every four years and transporting hundreds of thousands of athletes and spectators from all over the world â€“ for a couple of weeks of sport. This week, One Planet visits the Olympic site in East London to find out. Mike chats with David Stubbs, head of Sustainability for London 2012, about what's been done to make the park and its visitors more sustainable. Also on the show, we look back at last week's Rio+20 summit. What did it achieve, if anything? The BBC's Science Editor David Shukman tells us. Plus, we hear from Jamaica, which might have found a new money-making industry - in its herbs. As ever, have a listen and let us know what you think.
