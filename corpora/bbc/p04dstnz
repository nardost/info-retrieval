Swedish pop group ABBA burst onto the scene in 1974, sweeping to victory in the Eurovision Song Contest with their song, Waterloo. The band split up in 1982, and ever since fans have been begging them to get back together. It was announced recently that they would be reuniting for a virtual reality experience. Three years ago band member Bjorn Ulvaeus told us what it would take to get the group back together. When Yugoslavia broke up in the 1990s, the region was plunged into a bloody war. Zrinko Ogresta was a film maker in Croatia, and was hugely affected by the conflict. He lost part of his family and his hometown was destroyed. Twenty-five years later, Zrinko has found a way to forgive his enemies. He spoke to Outlook's Hilary Dunn. In 1994 a South African woman named Alison was attacked and raped after a man got into her car. She made the decision to speak out about her ordeal and became one of the first women in the country to do so. A documentary has been made about Alison which has been winning awards at festivals all over the world. Photo: Bjorn Ulvaeus sitting in front of a picture of the group.
