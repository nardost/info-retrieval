Last Broadcast Date: Sun 28 Jul 2019
Margaret Harrod was a nun and her twin brother was a priest. They were inseparable, but one day while visiting a parish family Margaret witnessed her brother doing something that would shock her to the core. It brought up memories that she had tried to bury and ultimately forced her to blow the whistle on her own twin brother. Margaret talks openly about child sexual abuse throughout this programme and it may be difficult and triggering to hear. If you are affected by anything in Margaret's interview the BBC has a website where you can get advice and more information: www.bbc.co.uk/actionline Presenter: Saskia Edwards Producer: Tom Harding Assinder Image: Twins Margaret Harrod and her brother Michael wearing their Catholic religious clothing Credit: Margaret Harrod Show less
