UK dance music pioneer Goldie turned his tough upbringing in the care system into the motivation to make a success of his music career later in life. Born Clifford Joseph Price, he was just three years old when he was abandoned by his mother. He grew up in the care system in England, constantly moving between foster families and children's homes. Landscape photographers Diane Cook and Len Jenshel travel the world taking pictures of trees with stories to tell. From Isaac Newton's apple tree in England to a Callery pear tree that was found under the wreckage of the World Trade Center and was replanted at the National September 11 Memorial in Manhattan. In India tens of thousands of children are trafficked every year. Many of them end up in prostitution and those responsible are rarely brought to justice. The international organisation Free a Girl has set up a programme to tackle the problem. Our reporter Rumella Dasgupta has been to meet the women who are being helped to rebuild their lives by learning about the law.
