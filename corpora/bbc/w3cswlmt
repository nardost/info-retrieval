Lauren Wasser grew up surrounded by beauty. Both her parents were models, and she first graced the pages of Italian Vogue herself when she was just a baby. But in 2012, while she was having her period, she became extremely ill. It turned out that while using tampons Lauren had contracted a rare case of toxic shock syndrome, or TSS. Lauren survived, but eventually lost both of her legs below the knee. Lauren has now returned to modelling and is even back on the basketball court. For more information about TSS, see related links below. Tucked away under the bustling streets of London is a rather special magic shop. We're talking about old school magic tricks, decks of cards, disappearing coins and even hats for pulling out bunny rabbits. What makes this shop special is the family who run it, because they have been doing magic since 1898, making it the world's oldest family-run magic business. It's even been confirmed by the Guinness World Records. Outlook's Saskia Edwards paid them a visit. When we sent our reporter Joel Cox to a small patch of land in the south west of Scotland, he found himself surrounded by dozens of animals of various species. But he wasn't on a farm, and many of these animals are sick or at the end of their lives. They're being taken care of in their final days by an extraordinary animal lover called Alexis Fleming.
