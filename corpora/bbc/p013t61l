Italian Giuseppe Gulotta was 18 years old when the police falsely accused him of murder in 1976. He spent two years in prison then the next twelve at liberty until his trial took place in 1990, and he was given a life sentence. He tells us how he was finally exonerated last year, and was able to marry his partner Michela Aronica, who stood by him throughout his imprisonment and never doubted his innocence. Also, another fight for justice with the story of Peter Lambert, who was one of 44 people who died when the British ship the MV Derbyshire sank in 1980 off the coast of Japan. The British government initially refused to open a full-scale inquiry, and the tragedy was blamed on poor seamanship. We hear how Peter's brother Paul began a campaign to find out what really happened and to clear his brother's name. And the Taiwanese woman who is trying to revive the tradition of hiring professional mourners to take part in family funerals. Picture: Michela (l) and Guiseppe Gulotta on their wedding day. Show less
