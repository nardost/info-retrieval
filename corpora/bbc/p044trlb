Philip Dodd looks at the impact that mass tourism on cruise liners can have. He talks to the people who benefit from the arrival of the huge new ships, and those who are unhappy about the environmental impact. He talks to the Mayor of Venice who believes his city can cope, and others who believe Venice is at huge risk of lasting environmental damage. He also talks to the experts on Antarctica, who analyse a situation where increasing numbers of people want to experience the beauty of one of the last remaining wildernesses of the world.
