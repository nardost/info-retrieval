In 1990, journalist Lorraine Murphy had an unsettling encounter with a man she'd met through work. More than 20 years later, she found out who he was - Canada's most prolific serial killer, Robert Pickton. As a young girl Outlook Inspirations nominee Esenam Nyador was always challenging the norm. She set up a biscuit stall aged 14. Later in life she wanted to become a tipper truck driver but no one from this male dominated industry would train her. So Esenam took on another challenge, she set herself up as one of very few female taxi drivers in Ghana. She's been running her business for five years. Although some clients refuse to get in the cab when they see she is a woman, many are delighted to be driven by her.

He's now an authority on insect venom, and the pain it inflicts. Image: Lorraine Murphy Credit: Jess Sloss Show less
