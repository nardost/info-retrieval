72-year-old Judith Sheindlin is one of the highest paid TV stars in the world. Never heard of her? She's better known as Judge Judy. For nearly 20 years, she's been handing down on-screen judgments in the real-life disputes of ordinary Americans. Jack Stewart met her backstage in Hollywood. 15-year-old Jessa Balote lives in the Tondo district of Manila - one of the poorest and most dangerous parts of the city. Her family survives by scavenging through huge mounds of rubbish every night. But thanks to Jessa's talents as a dancer, their lives are starting to improve. Levison Wood is a former British soldier turned explorer who recently attempted to walk the entire length of the Nile, the longest river in the world. The journey took him through savannahs, swamps, rain forests and warzones. Ennio Morricone is one of the most famous and prolific film composers. His music has been the backdrop of almost 500 movies, including one of the most famous film scores in Hollywood history: The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. Now aged 86, he's back on tour.
