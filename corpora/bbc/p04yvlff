In the final part of Outlook's Haiti season Jo Fidgen meets the young people who feel they can make a difference to their country through sounds, voices and instruments. Electronic dance music DJ and producer Michael Brun has been called the Haitian sensation. He tours the world headlining festivals and parties, but always carries a Haitian flag with him to remind him of home. Michael's ambition is to change the negative image of his country, which he's doing through his hit Wherever I Go, which went viral in minutes. To get an authentic Haitian sound for the song he collaborated with music students at the Audio Institute in the south of Haiti. Schneidine Phidelmond was brought up to challenge female stereotypes and not be a 'slave to a man'. She's chosen sound engineering and studies at the Audio Institute. Schneidine wants to make Haiti sound better and she also feels that her generation should embrace Haiti's traditional voodoo music, instead of seeing it as evil. Princess Eud is one of Haiti's best known female rappers. She's made it in a male industry and her powerful lyrics point to women's right and injustices. Princess Eud also wants her generation to reconnect with their traditional roots and has her own fashion label, which is influenced by African designs. (Picture credit: BBC.) Show less
