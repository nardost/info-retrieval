City life: about a third of all Indians enjoy or endure it now, but in the next 15-20 years, the majority of the country’s inhabitants are expected to become urban dwellers. Can the country cope with such a large population movement? And what are the best ways to ensure that India’s cities work for everyone? To discuss the challenges and opportunities of India's urbanisation, Ritula Shah visits the City Lab conference in London, a global gathering of people who spend their working lives trying to improve the urban experience. She is joined by writer and environmentalist Sunita Narain; Sheela Patel, who champions the urban poor; and architect and urban planner Bimal Patel. Photo: A New Delhi street (Getty Images) Show less
