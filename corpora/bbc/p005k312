The Hager Family Not so long ago, most people in the US were farmers. But now only about one in a hundred works the land. And yet farmers and ranchers are as important as ever - they're the stewards of almost half the land in North America. And most of the country's agriculture is still run by families. The Hager family own a 700 acre dairy farm in Massachusetts. Chip and Sherry Hager run the farm, along with their daughter Kim and son-in-law Aaron, and another son, Todd. Both Kim and Aaron are college graduates with degrees in agriculture. John Biewen (bee-win) of the centre for Documentary Studies at Duke University followed the family through the different farming cycles of the year. Show less
