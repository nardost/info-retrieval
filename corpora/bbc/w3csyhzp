Dutch rapper Sor and his group, Black Acid, were rising rapidly through the Amsterdam music scene. They seemed poised to hit the big time when Sor was struck down by a mysterious illness, culminating in the devastating morning when he woke up without any hearing at all. The road to recovery was long, but with the help of technology, Sor was able to regain some hearing and start making music again. He told Andile Masuku about how deafness has both affected and inspired him. Ronald Mallett is an astrophysicist and professor of physics at the University of Connecticut. Inspired by the death of his father when he was 10 years old, Ronald has dedicated much of his adult life and career to making time travel possible.
