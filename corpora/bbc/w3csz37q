In 2002, Mauritanian engineer Mohamedou Salahi was detained by American intelligence services. They believed he was a senior figure in al-Qaeda and took him to Guantanamo Bay, the notorious US prison camp. Mohamedou was held there for 14 years without charge, during which time he says he was tortured. A glimmer of light came in the form of an unexpected and life-changing friendship he would make with Steve Wood, one of his American guards. This is the second of two parts. You can find the first episode by searching for 'Me, Guantanamo Bay, and a new friend'. A single BBC Outlook podcast comprising both parts is also available. Mohamedou Salahi has written about his experience in a book called 'Guantanamo Diary'.
