The 25 of January is National Police Day in Egypt - a date deliberately chosen by a small group of middle-class professionals to stage a demonstration against the repression of the Mubarak state. They couldn't have dreamt that 18 days later, they would have chased the president from office. Much of the action took place in Tahrir Square in Cairo, where blood was shed and lives were lost, but where the demonstrators stood their ground. BBC World Service Arab Affairs Analyst Magdi Abdelhadi talks to Egyptians about the revolution and their hopes and fears for a 'new Egypt'. A podcast of this documentary will be available soon.
