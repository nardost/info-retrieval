Bala Amarasekaran runs a sanctuary for chimpanzees just outside Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, and he has brought us his personal experience of living in the country during the Ebola outbreak. He thinks the crisis is worse than the civil war, and he has told us how it is affecting the everyday life at the Tacugama sanctuary. We also speak to singing nun Sister Cristina Scuccia, who won Italy's talent show The Voice. As a young woman she had to choose between singing and the Church - now she combines them, and has just released her first album Sister Cristina. Mona Seraji is an Iranian top snowboard instructor. In 2013 she broke her spine in a ski jumping accident and thought she would never walk again, but a few months later she was standing on a beach in Chabahar, Iran's most southerly city, ready to start a new adventure. She is now one of the first female surfers in the country. And Belgian artist Koen Vanmechelen, who celebrates chickens through photography and video installation. He has been cross breeding hens and roosters from across the world to create his acclaimed Cosmopolitan Chicken Project. His latest project takes place in the labyrinthine tunnels of the 200-year-old crypt of St Pancras Church in London. Show less
