Harrison Okene is a Nigerian cook who was dramatically rescued from the seabed. He was trapped for almost three days in an air bubble under his sunken ship and says he'll never go near the sea again.. Meet Sher Singh, one of the Indian postal service's few remaining 'dak' runners who delivers the mail on foot - through forests and mountains, in rain and snow - to reach the farthest-flung addresses. Brazilian writer Diogo Mainardi has written an unlikely bestseller devoted to his son Tito who has cerebral palsy. His book, The Fall, follows Tito's wobbly steps around the world from Venice to Rio de Janeiro. South Africans Ginn Fourie and Letlapa Mphahlele tell us why they are promoting peace and reconciliation, although Letlapa ordered the attack in which Ginn's daughter died. They tell their story in a new documentary, Beyond Forgiving. And Liina Viira is an Estonian fashion designer inspired by folk costumes to create new styles, including giving traditional underwear a fashion makeover.
