As the catwalk models parade exotic and stylish new creations for London Fashion week, we ask if the current economic crisis and globalisation now hold more sway on what we wear than what is in fashion? Anthropologist Daniel Miller on the rise and rise of blue jeans which he says are so popular because they stand apart from fashion and allow the wearer to assimilate and feel like they are a citizen of the world. Fashion curator Sonnet Stanfill on the impact of economics on high end expensive clothing like ball gowns. And one of Nigeria's top fashion designers, Folake Folarin-Coker reveals how she has created an iconic African fashion brand which is at once globally friendly and affordable.
