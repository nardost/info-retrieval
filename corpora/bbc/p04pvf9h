David is struggling to bring up his three young children alone, after his wife died due to complications after an unsafe abortion. Malawi has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, and at least 17% percent of these deaths are due to unsafe abortions. At the moment a woman who tries to procure an abortion in Malawi faces up to 14 years in jail, unless doctors can prove that the woman's life would be at risk if she continues the pregnancy. Malawiâ€™s parliament is now poised to vote on a controversial Termination of Pregnancy Bill after more than two years of fierce debate and consultation. If the legislation passes, it will bring this southern African state into line with many other countries in Europe and North America, where abortion is permitted if the mother or baby's life is in danger, in instances of rape or incest, or where going ahead with the pregnancy would present a mental or physical health risk to the woman. But as Chipiliro Kansilanga reports, the issue has split Malawian society and put many politicians and health officials at odds with religious leaders.
