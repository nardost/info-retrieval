Syrian Jalal Aro runs a rather unusual museum in Paris about the history of recorded sound. It's full of phonographs - early machines that used cylinders to play sound - as well as gramophones, record players and turntables. Outlook's Emily Webb went to meet him.

New Zealander Geoff Marsland is an experienced sailor. Last month, he and three friends were sailing to the Pacific island of Tonga, when the weather shifted and pushed them off course.
