Stanley Underhill is a British priest who—at 91—came out as gay. He spent his whole life facing prejudice because of his sexuality but says that for the first time in his life, he's comfortable in himself. He spoke to Outlook’s Emily Webb. He’s written a book about his life called Coming out of the Black Country. Noriko Kishida and Yukiko Dazai started Japan’s first official women’s rugby team, Liberty Fields. They took part in the 1991 Women’s World Cup in Wales, lost miserably but inspired future generations of women in Japan to play. American veterinarian Paul Ramos performed surgery on an orangutan that was attacked in a jungle in Borneo. Image: Stanley Underhill Credit: The Charterhouse Show less
