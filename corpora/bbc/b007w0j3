THE OPRAH PHENOMENON The Oprah Winfrey show is probably the highest rated show in television history and Oprah Winfrey herself, now aged fifty three, is one of the world’s most influential women. Jennifer Harris, Professor of English at Mount Allison University in Canada, is Co-Editor of a recently published work of cultural criticism entitled The Oprah Phenomenon. She talks to Laurie about Oprah and her extraordinary appeal. COMPLEXITY THEORY Complexity science studies all kinds of different complex systems which exist in the world, looking for a commonality which can be explained mathematically. It is hoped by the adherents that Complexity theory can provide a theory of change which can explain and predict change in a host of different areas, from the rise and fall of the stock market to traffic jams on the M25. Laurie Taylor is joined by Neil Johnson, Professor of Physics from Oxford University, currently working at the University of Miami in Florida, author of Two’s Company, Three Is Complexity and David Byrne, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Sociology and Social Policy at the University of Durham.
