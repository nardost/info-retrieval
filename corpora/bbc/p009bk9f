Captain Kevin Ivison In 2006 bomb disposal expert Captain Kevin Ivison was serving with the British army in the dangerous Iraqi territory of Al Amarah. The soldiers' base was under nightly rocket attack and Kevin and his team were repeatedly called on to put IEDs - or improvised explosive devices out of action . In February of that year he took what the bomb disposal experts call "the longest walk" towards an unexploded device in circumstances that would change his life forever. His actions on that day won him the George Medal for bravery - presented by the Queen - but they also brought to an end his army career. Hear Kevin's extraordinary story in this special edition of Outlook with Matthew Bannister. Show less
