Personal stories behind the news from all over the world. With Matthew Bannister. How an Israeli tank commander and a member of Fatah joined forces to fight for peace. Combatants for Peace They once confronted each other down the barrel of a gun - but a group of former Israeli and Palestinian combatants turned their back on violence and began working together to promote the idea of peace in the Middle East. Chen Alon was an Israeli tank commander and Nour Shehadeh was a local leader of the Palestinian faction Fatah. They tell Matthew about the project. Staring back People tend to look at Kevin Michael Connolly. He's young, fit, and a champion skier, but Kevin was born without legs. He got so fed up with people staring at him that he decided to stare back - through the lens of his camera. Kevin set off on a trip round the world, taking thirty two thousand photos of people staring at him, in 31 cities and in 15 different countries. Now he's published some of the photos as part of a memoir called Double Take. Show less
