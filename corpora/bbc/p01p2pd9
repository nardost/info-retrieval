New Yorker Elaine Joseph tells Matthew Bannister about her 35-year search for the body of her baby daughter Tomika, who died when she was just a few days old. Elaine believes Tomika's body may be in a public burial ground known as Potters Field off the coast of New York. We meet Guido Fuentes - the Argentinian man who has set up a fashion school in the slums of Buenos Aires. The project is as much about building self esteem as it is strutting the catwalk. Also on the programme, interpreter Ioannis Ikonomou is Greek but speaks more than 30 languages. He tells us about his biggest challenge - learning Mandarin. And, BBC reporter Tom Brook takes us behind the scenes of the Hollywood campaigns aimed at securing a coveted Oscar nomination. (Picture: Elaine Joseph.
