The story of a top Irish jockey who came back from the dead. Declan Murphy suffered a terrible head injury after a fall at the height of his career. It left him in a coma in hospital and British newspapers published his obituary. But Declan pulled through and managed to ride again. Lauren Fern-Watt grew up with an alcoholic mother. But her 160 pound dog, called Gizelle, helped her pull through. When Lauren found out her dog had terminal cancer, she made a bucket list for her, so they could cherish every last moment together. Rap music is controversial in Afghanistan. But Sayed Jamal Mubarez has managed to break the norm by being the first rapper to win Afghan Star, a popular singing competition in the country. Sayed uses rap music as an outlet to talk about Afghan society, and his own difficulties. (Photo: Declan Murphy riding for the first time after his near fatal accident.
