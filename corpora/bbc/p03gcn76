Stories of chance: accidental meetings and events which can change everything. In 1998 Kenyan Douglas Sidialo was driving to work when he happened to see a commotion at the US embassy, pulling over he got caught up in an Al Qaeda bomb attack. Since then he has overcome blindness to become a record breaking adventurer. Douglas' accidental encounter with death transformed his life. But South Korean funeral director Jeong Yong Moon doesn't leave anything to chance. He runs a rather odd business, helping thousands of people act out their own funeral by climbing into a coffin for ten minutes. Ahmad Alhameed was working in a field hospital in Syria when he was arrested by government forces. After six months imprisonment he was taken to court on 11 terrorism charges and resigned himself to being found guilty, but luck was about to go his way... Our final story takes place 12-thousand feet over the US state of Wisconsin. It was 2013, and in a routine flight, two planes were carrying sky diving instructor Mike Robinson and eight other experienced jumpers to the drop zone. But when the two planes collided mid-air, the odds were stacked against them. Photo: (L) Douglas Sidialo. Credit: Jean de Plessis. Photo: (R) Mike Robinson. Show less
