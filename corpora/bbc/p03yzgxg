America is in the middle of its most volatile presidential election season in half a century. The traditional political parties are being shaken to the core by voters who are not necessarily Democrats or Republicans, so called 'independent' voters. So far independents have led to the polarising figure of Donald Trump gaining the Republican nomination and the unlikely figure of Bernie Sanders leading a serious challenge to the Democrats', HIllary Clinton. What might the independents do next? Michael Goldfarb travels to the key state of Ohio - a state that has voted for every presidential winner over the last 50 years - to meet with independent voters. He explores the anger that is motivating independents this year. He places their views in the deeper historical context of changes in American society - changes that have hit Ohio hard.
