Outlook is back in Haiti and this time Jo Fidgen meets some of the extraordinary people who worked to save lives during Hurricane Matthew. Ertha Cressido Papillon opened her home to hundreds of people from her village who had lost their homes in the category four storm. Ertha's house is not big, there was standing room only, but people were safe because it was a concrete structure. Melissa Mecklembourg and Jacquelin Petit work for Haiti Air Ambulance, they were in the skies not long after the hurricane struck delivering aid and assistance. They take Jo on a helicopter ride to one of the affected areas and introduce her to Dr Marie Magalie Veillard, who is the medical director of OFATMA hospital in Les Cayes. This was the only hospital in this part of Haiti working in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane and because many of the roads were broken, injured patients had to walk for hours and sometimes days to get there.
