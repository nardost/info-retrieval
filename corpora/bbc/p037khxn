Known by many in her country as 'The Lady', Aung San Suu Kyi has become one of the world's most famous female politicians. And yet she has never exercised any power in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, until now. Aung San Suu Kyi's political career, which began dramatically with the failed uprising of 1988, has been shaped by the memory of her father, General Aung San, who is regarded as the founder of modern Burma. Her life has been marked by loss: her father was assassinated when she was two, her older brother died six years later and her British husband, Michael Aris, died when she was under house arrest. How has Aung San Suu Kyi remained committed to her struggle to bring democracy to the country?
