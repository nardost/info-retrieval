This BBC World Service series has been tracking the lives of East Londoners living on a deprived housing estate, in the shadow of the 2012 Olympic Park for the past two years. Episode 6: Acting Bad In dense blocks of flats and social housing, just 10 minutes way from the Olympics Park, young people, with nothing much else to do, are at risk of gangs. The BBC's Nina Robinson explores the problem of crime for those affected. (Image: The riverside Olympic site. Credit: Associated Press) Show less
