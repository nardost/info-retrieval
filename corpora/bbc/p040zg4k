Durge Kami is a Nepalese high school student - possibly the only one in the country with eight grandchildren! He's 68 and decided to go back to school seven years ago to learn to read and write as poverty prevented him from going to school when he was a child. He says his learning is already changing his life. In the midst of the Syrian war, Dr Hatem is a paediatrician working in the rebel-held part of the city of Aleppo. He describes a trip he made to Turkey in April that had agonising repercussions. American Louise Pascale collected Afghan children's songs when she was working in the country in the 1960s. After the Taliban fell, she decided to return to Afghanistan forty years later to reintroduce the songs. Hannah Engelkamp is a travel writer who walked 1,000 miles around Wales - and took a donkey along for company. The idea seemed simple enough. The donkey could carry her bags and provide her with much-needed company on the six-month adventure. So what could possibly go wrong? Ran Feinstein and Ofer Ra'anan are from the Israeli city of Ra'anana, and get together on free days and weekends to explore the coastline around the country. Three months ago a dive off the ancient port of Caesarae brought some unexpected treasure.
