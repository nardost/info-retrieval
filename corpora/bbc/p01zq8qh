Gold has long been a symbol of wealth and power, but it also has spiritual significance, and today itâ€™s even used to treat cancer. Matthew Taylor talks about the many values of gold with Kwasi Kwarteng, a member of Parliament in the UK and author of War and Gold; Maria Alicia Uribe, who is director of the Gold Museum in Colombia; and gold nano-particle scientist Nicholas Kotov.
