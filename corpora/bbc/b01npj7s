Emma Griffin, one of Radio 3's New Generation Thinkers, gives a talk on what makes a good mother today, recorded at the Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival 2012. Historian Emma Griffin of the University of East Anglia turns to the poor of Victorian Britain to ask what made a good mother then in families struggling to keep body and soul together. She finds that our own values and ideas about motherhood may not be as instinctive as we like to believe. The Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival takes place at The Sage Gateshead Friday 2 - Sunday 4 November and is broadcast for three weeks on Radio 3 from Friday 2 November. The New Generation Thinkers are winners of a talent scheme run by BBC Radio 3 and the Arts and Humanities Research Council to find the brightest academic minds in the arts and humanities with the potential to turn their ideas into broadcasts.
