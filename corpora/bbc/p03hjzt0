That was in 2005 but more than ten years on Laxmi has not only found love but has become the face of an Indian fashion company. She told Matthew Bannister about the moment of the attack. When Richard Starapoli was a young Secret Service agent in New York City, he never knew where his next assignment would take him. Jobs involved running security checks on venues where high profile guests would be staying. One day, a very important guest was headed to the city - the president of the United States of America. When he went to run checks on the president's hotel, he stumbled across a surprising find, a secret railway carriage! Corporal Derceo da Costa has worked on the Uruguayan Antarctic Base every year for the past 31 years. He helped set up his country's first scientific base and he is one of the longest serving workers on the icy continent. But now he is on his final mission and in March this year he will leave Antarctica for the last time. Reporter Gibby Zobel travelled to South Shetland Islands in the Antarctic to meet him. British writer Angela Clarke's latest book Follow Me is a crime thriller whose subject matter is very close to her own heart. The main character is a journalist who is victimised by an internet troll - someone who sends highly abusive and threatening messages to strangers online. She writes from bitter personal experience as she was herself targeted by a number of internet trolls. (Photo: Acid attack survivor Laxmi Saa modelling. Credit: Viva N Diva) Show less
