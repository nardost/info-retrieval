How does a Korean boy end up playing the most Australian of sports, Australian Rules Football? Peter Bell became a legendary player, but all the while a personal secret was lingering in the background. Peter was adopted and had been raised in Australia. What Peter didn't know was that his birth mother had been searching for him for years. This month and last, fashion weeks have been staged around the world. Which might make you conjure up an image of svelte, Amazonian models loping down catwalks. But there's one agency that's rewriting the rules on what a model can look like. All the models in this 'inclusive' agency have disabilities. Dany Mitzman went backstage to meet them. Natalia Ponce De Leon is one of our 2016 winners of Outlook Inspirations. In 2014, Natalia was the victim of one of the most savage acid attacks ever recorded in Colombia, a country with one of the worst records for acid attacks in the world. Natalia was left disfigured, and her face has had to be reconstructed. She started a campaign for acid attacks to be recognised as a serious and specific crime, carrying a maximum prison sentence of 50 years. A new law was brought in to that effect, and named after her. Jo Fidgen caught up with Natalia to ask about her memories from the Outlook Inspiration awards. As an undergraduate at Harvard College, Ben Schatz was torn between pursuing a career as a gay activist and a career in theatre. Ben became a lawyer and once advised former US President Bill Clinton. But Ben quit his law work to focus on being a full-time drag queen with his Dragapella group the Kinsey Sicks. (Picture: Peter Bell. Credit: Paul Kane/Getty Images.) Show less
