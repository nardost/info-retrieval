When internationally-renowned art restorer Dianne Modestini was asked to work on an old, damaged painting in 2005, she had no idea it would go on to become the worldâ€™s most expensive. The painting of Christ was believed to be inspired by the Italian master Leonardo da Vinci, but was eventually attributed to the artist himself. It went on to sell at auction for US $450,000,000. Dianne's relationship with the picture was deeply emotional, connecting her to her late husband, himself a noted conservator. Lakshmi Sharma from the Indian state of Bihar has become a role model for young women wanting to break into journalism. She was a teenage mum but a surprising opportunity to report on rural affairs led her to the top of her profession. Image: Dianne Modestini with the Salvator Mundi (Cheryl Rossum) Show less
