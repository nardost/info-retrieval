Professor Sunil Khilnani presents the stories of four great characters from the history of India. Shivaji, the 17th Century warrior-king, is today a symbol of Hindu identity. We examine his incarnation as a role model for deal-makers and networkers. William Jones was the greatest Orientalist of his time. His studies changed not just the way the world sees India but how Indians would come to see their own culture. Lakshmibai, Rani of Jhansi, became a heroine of the 1857 Rebellion. Through her life and death, Sunil explores the portrayal of women in Indian history. Social reformer Jyotirao Phule left a deep legacy, although in his day his commitment to educating women and members of the lower castes was seen as scandalous. Show less
