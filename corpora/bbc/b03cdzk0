Tom Sutcliffe discusses the role and place of contemporary art in today's global, digital world with the artist Grayson Perry. While the Director of Tate Britain Penelope Curtis looks back to a time when images held such power and caused such outrage that they had to be destroyed, in an exhibition on iconoclasm. Philip Davis offers a defence of the value of reading serious literature. And Nicholas Lovell looks at the money that artists can make, using the internet to change the way they relate to their fans.
