Dr David Ores is creating a network of tattoo removal clinics across the US that provide their service free of charge. The condition is that the people they help are former gang members, ex-cons or human trafficking survivors. It makes it easier for them to find work, stay out of prison and rebuild their lives. Bishnu Maya Pariyar was born into the lowest caste of Nepal, the Dalit. They are also known as 'untouchables'. Despite this, she has gone on to accrue a clutch of awards and qualifications, including an honorary doctorate. Bishnu has devoted her time to educating and training Dalits in Nepal. At a young age Catherine Davies became obsessed with the Welsh rock band, The Manic Street Preachers. It inspired her to create her own album called Confessions of a Romance Novelist, which has just been nominated for the Welsh Music Prize. Zahra Yaganah has written one of the fastest selling books in Afghanistan. It is based on her own life and details what it is like to be married to a violent man. The book is challenging taboos around domestic abuse and is proving popular with both men and women. (Photo: Dr David Ores outside his New York clinic. Credit: Bella Finn Parisot) Show less
