Many of us are fluent in at least one language and some people are proficient in two, three, four or even more. But not all languages around the world are in good health. In fact it is thought that at least half of the languages that are alive today could cease to be spoken by the end of this century. What can we do about it? How do you re-awaken hibernating or dying languages and the cultures that go with them? Or, is some extinction inevitable? Bridget Kendall discusses the positive things that are happening with some minority languages, focusing on Australia, Nepal and Hawaii with linguists Professor Ghilâ€™ad Zuckermann and Dr. Candace Kaleimamoowahinekapu Galla and anthropologist Dr. Mark Turin.
