Jane Little presents Radio 4's obituary programme, analysing and reflecting on the lives of people who have recently died. On Last Word this week: Financier turned royal courtier Sir John Riddell, who as private secretary to both the Prince and Princess of Wales remained on good terms with both. Lolita Lebron who led a gun attack on the US House of Representatives to make the case for Puerto Rican independence. Screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz who revived the fortunes of James Bond and saved Superman. Donald Shiley, whose artificial heart valve was credited with prolonging thousands of lives. And Eric Tindill who until his death held the distinction of being the oldest surviving Test cricketer in the world and an All Blacks Rugby player. Producer: Neil George. Show less
