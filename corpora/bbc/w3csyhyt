Lolita Wästerlund had always wanted to be a mother but was born without a womb (also known as uterus). Her sister Linda, on the other hand, never imagined that she would become a parent. So when Linda fell pregnant she was afraid of telling Lolita. Lolita decided that she had to be there for her sister despite her jealousy. But when Lolita heard about pioneering uterus transplants happening in Sweden, everything changed. Linda had a uterus transplant so Lolita could carry a child of her own.
