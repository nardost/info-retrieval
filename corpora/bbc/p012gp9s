South African swimming coach Sthembiso Madiya kept his township pool open through years of violence and influenced a generation of local youngsters. He's joined on Outlook by one of the boys he taught, lifeguard-turned-actor Sihle Xaba; and film-maker Sara Blecher, who used Sthembiso's story as the starting point for her award-winning film Otelo Burning.
