When Brisa de Angulo was a teenager she was raped by a relative. After a traumatic experience in court, she vowed to make the process of justice easier for sexual abuse survivors in Bolivia. Chilean Elba Munoz spends her days taking care of more than 100 monkeys. She gave up her career as a midwife to look after them. Her monkey rescue and rehabilitation centre is just outside the capital Santiago. Many of the monkeys there have been saved from illegal trafficking or were abandoned by pet owners and circuses. Emma Carey grew up in the Australian capital Canberra and was obsessed with sport. While holidaying in Switzerland, she got to fulfil one of her dreams: skydiving. However, things took a horrible turn. Emma's parachute and the emergency backup had become tangled and choked her instructor unconscious. She survived the crash landing and says there are positives from the accident. Very often musicians have a resurgence. Well, for one British reggae singer, Macka B, his new fame has come in an interesting form: he makes viral raps about the benefits of fruits and vegetables. (Picture: Brisa de Angulo.
