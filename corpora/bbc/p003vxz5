Personal stories behind the news from all over the world. With Jonathan Charles. On today's programme: human rights in Chechnya; lost boys of Sudan; Iraq's new youth orchestra. Human Rights in Chechnya Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch tells us about the dangers she faces investigating abuses against civilians in Chechnya. Her friend and fellow-campaigner Natasha Estemirova was killed there in July, and two other activists were murdered this week. The Lost Boy Aher Arop Bol became one of the so-called 'lost boys' of Sudan when he was separated from his parents by war at the age of 3. Now he's putting his younger brothers through school with a street stall in South Africa, and he's written a book about his remarkable life. National Youth Orchestra of Iraq Buran Aziz Zaza from Kurdistan tells us about the pressures, and pleasures, of playing in Iraq's new youth orchestra, which has its inaugural concert this weekend. The orchestra has brought together young people from all Iraq's religious and ethnic groups. Show less
