Peter Staley was one of the ACT UP activists whose campaigns helped to turn AIDS from a death sentence into a manageable condition. Their story is told in the Oscar-nominated documentary How To Survive A Plague. The 88 year old musician Anita Lasker-Wallfisch is a survivor of the concentration camps at Auschwitz and Belsen where she played the cello in the camp orchestra. In 1996 she published a memoir of her life during the war called Inherit The Truth which is being republished for the 75th anniversary of Kristallnacht. Luis Moreno-Ocampo was the very first prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in the Hague. He served a nine year term from 2003 to 2012. He was born and brought up in Argentina, where he first came to prominence as a lawyer working on the prosecution of the military junta led by General Jorge Videla. He went on to lead high profile corruption and human rights cases within Argentina. And, an unusual listener love story: Abby Rasminsky and David Goldstein who spent their first date sheltering from a storm.
