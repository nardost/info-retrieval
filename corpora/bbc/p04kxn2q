Last Broadcast Date: Tue 3 Jan 2017
Carrie Goldberg is a pioneering American lawyer who specialises in cases of so-called 'revenge porn' - or non-consensual pornography. A typical situation would be an angry ex distributing intimate photos or video clips - often on the internet - without the consent of the person in those images. It can have devastating consequences, and Carrie takes it very personally when she hears about such attacks on a person's privacy - because, as she tells Outlook's Jo Fidgen, she was a victim of it herself. Lateif Jorephani, a British-Iraqi film producer talks about his work on the troubled epic Clash of Loyalties. Commissioned by Saddam Hussein in the early 1980s the film was intended to be a big budget, Hollywood-style retelling of the origins of modern Iraq. However, just weeks after filming began, war broke out between Iraq and Iran. Lateif recalls what went on behind the scenes. Joao Galdino is a retired dentist and scientist who is passionate about wildlife. For 55 years he's been going to zoos across Brazil fixing the teeth of bears, jaguars, monkeys and all sorts of animals. In his spare time, he became an amateur taxidermist and over the years has stuffed thousands of animals. He's now used his collection to set up a natural history museum in his hometown in southern Brazil. French-born artist Henri Barande is known all over the world for his large-scale paintings, and his sculptures. But for many years, he hid his artwork from public view. His works are all unsigned, undated, untitled - and he will almost never put them on show. So when he did agree to exhibit at the Saatchi Gallery in London recently, it caused a bit of a stir. Outlook's Tim Allen went to meet Henri, who told him how he started making sculptures as a boy out of the most unexpected material: bread. Image: Carrie Goldberg, Credit: L Pratt Show less
