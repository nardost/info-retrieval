Wanted: Rich man to give poor student better life. Must provide cash allowance, luxury holidays and designer goods in return for…..? Emma Jane Kirby meets the young British women funding themselves through university by dating rich older men via websites. And asks - who is exploiting who? She meets those who sees sugar dating as the perfect transactional relationship in which both parties get exactly what they want including those at some of England's top Russell Group Universities. People like the student who had two sugar daddies at University so that she could fully concentrate on her studies and achieve a First Class degree. Her Mum didn't just know about it, she approved, calling it a " great, great solution" to the family's financial problems. And we meet Sugar Daddies, to get their point of view: " I pay my current sugar baby £2,000 a month plus £1,000 shopping allowance. Do I want sex as part of my arrangement? Yes, of course.....Expectations go both ways." Producer: Jim Frank (Image: actors representing a sugar baby and a sugar daddy) Show less
