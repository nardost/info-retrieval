When Becky Groves was 12, she was struck by a virus that caused her brain to swell up. She was put into a coma and doctors feared she wouldn't recover. They advised her mother Jo Emery to switch off her life support machine, but things don't always work out as you think they will. Jonathan Van Ness grew up in a small town in the American state of Illinois. He was the first male cheerleader at his high school and these days he's a star hairdresser on a popular Netflix TV show. As a little girl in south London, Nequela Whittaker was a pretty good kid. She had a talent for the violin, but as she grew up that same violin would land her in trouble as she started selling drugs to get money and respect. (Picture: Becky Groves. Credit: Jo Emery.)
