Antimo Magnotta was the resident pianist on board the Costa Concordia cruise ship, which sank five years ago this week. After his escape from the vessel he made his way to London, where he began working as a waiter at the world famous V&A Museum. These days Antimo can be found in the same caf√© where he waited tables, he's now working as one of the museum's house pianists. Tom Marcus - not his real name - was a spy, an undercover agent for the British security agency, MI5. A few years ago he spent several months pretending to be a homeless man living on the streets of north London. He went to great lengths to blend in, but it was all worth it when he ended up preventing two coaches full of school children from being blown up.
