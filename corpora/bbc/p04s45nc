French teenager Victoire Dauxerre was one of the most sought-after models in the world for eight months. She was doing all the major fashion shows, and photo shoots for A-list designers, but it almost destroyed her. She left the business seven years ago, and has now published a book about what she went through. Victoire tells Outlook about her shocking experience. In 1975 a 20 year old Swedish woman called Lotta von Schedvin drove to India with some friends for a few weeks' holiday. While she was there, she met a man in his mid-twenties, called PK Mahanandia, an impoverished art student, who made a bit of cash in the evenings by sketching tourists. They fell in love and PK ended up cycling all the way from India to Europe to be reunited with her. They tell Outlook about their extraordinary love journey. (Picture: Victoire Dauxerre.
