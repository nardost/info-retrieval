Libby Phelps grew up in the infamous anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church. Her grandfather, the late Fred Phelps founded the church which is largely made up of Libby's family members. For nearly two decades Libby's daily routine consisted of brandishing anti-gay slogans at pickets across the USA. Notoriously Libby and her family would even picket the funerals of soldiers who had been killed in action. The Church believes that these men and women died because they chose to serve a country which protects gay rights. Libby tells us about her life inside the Church and the events that led to her finally deciding to leave. Anita Karim is a trailblazer in the world of Mixed Martial Arts. She is Pakistan's first female professional fighter, in fact there are so few women involved in the sport that the 22-year-old trains with men. And a story of avian love. We hear the tale of a long-distance romance involving two incredibly committed love birds. (Image: Libby Phelps. Photo credit: Grace Phelps-Roper.) Show less
