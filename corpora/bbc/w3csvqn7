Ibrahim Halawa was not yet 18 when he went to visit his family in Egypt in 2013. He had planned to go to the party island of Ibiza before heading home to Ireland but instead he found himself caught up in the protests which followed the ousting of the former president and ended up spending four years in prison. Louise Groves lives in the UK and had a traumatic childhood after her parents both died when she was still young. Louise decided to turn her experiences into something positive by fostering 48 children over the years. Malala Yousafzai first came to the public's attention in 2009 as a schoolgirl who wrote a diary about her life under Taliban rule. Three years later she was shot in the head by militants for daring to go to school. Malala went on to become the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Her mother Toor Pekai Yousafzai has mostly kept out of the spotlight but agreed to speak to us about her daughter and their new life in the UK. (Photo: Ibrahim Halawa.
