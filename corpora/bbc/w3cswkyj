Shon Hopwood is a professor at one of the most respected law schools in the US, Georgetown in Washington. He has the most fantastic track record in petitioning the US Supreme Court to get prisoners' sentences reduced. It would be the envy of any lawyer, but is all the more remarkable when you consider that Shon used to be a bank robber. Natasha Coates is a British gymnastics champion. She has won 22 British gymnastics titles despite battling with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome that makes her allergic to nearly everything, including exercise. The Isle of Budelli in Italy is famous for its pink beach. Budelli is part of the La Maddalena National Park and only one person lives there. His name is Mauro Morandi and he has been living alone on the atoll for 29 years. (Image: Shon Hopwood. Photo courtesy of Shon Hopwood.) Show less
