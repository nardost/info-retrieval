In February 2017, President Trump made a speech to his supporters. He moved on to the topic of immigration and Sweden. "You look at what's happening last night in Sweden," he told the crowd at a rally in Florida. "They took in large numbers; they're having problems like they never thought possible". This confused the Swedes because they had not noticed anything happening that Friday night in their country. What Trump was referring to was a Fox News report he had seen about immigration and crime in Sweden. The report twisted a story by Ruth Alexander for the BBC’s More or Less programme and used misleading statistics to try to show that recent immigrants were responsible for a crime wave in Sweden. More or Less debunked the report and its use of statistics but since then there has been a spate of violent crime in Sweden. Ruth Alexander travels to Stockholm and Malmö to find out the truth about what is going on. (image: Sweden Flags, Credit: BBC) Producer: Keith Moore Show less
