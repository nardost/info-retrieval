The remarkable story of David Good, son of an American anthropologist and a Yanomami tribeswoman. He tells Matthew Bannister about his journey to the Amazon to find the mother who'd left him when he was five. Also, prize-winning Australian novelist Thomas Keneally on why he was inspired to write about First World War nurses in his most recent novel, "The Daughters Of Mars". And Witness goes to the archives for memories of the first ascent of Everest sixty years ago.
