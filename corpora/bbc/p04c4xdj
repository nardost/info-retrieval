Levi Bettweiser from the American city of Boise, Idaho, is on a photographic mission. He tells us how he has 'rescued' over 18,000 images from forgotten rolls of film by trawling the internet and second hand shops for old cameras that have undeveloped photographs inside them. Zenith Irfan from Pakistan was just 10 months old when her father died suddenly of a heart attack, so she has no memories of him. In her late teens the discovery of an old photograph gave Zenith an insight into her father's personality and his dream of travelling on a motorbike. She is now following in his footsteps and is known for whizzing around on her own motorbike. Rodrigo Reyes is a film director who has immortalised his family history on celluloid. He has uncovered the secret lives of Mexican peach pickers in California, inspired by an episode in his grandfather's life. Sam Bloom from Sydney, Australia, suffered a near-fatal fall in 2013 that left her paralysed from the chest down and in a deep depression. The process of nursing an abandoned magpie chick back to health enabled Sam to come out of her darkest days, and helped the family to heal. Sam's husband Cameron, who is a professional photographer, recorded everyday of life with their new feathered friend. (Photo: A family at the British seaside, Blackpool.
