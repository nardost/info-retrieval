Danuta Walesa was Poland's first lady while her Nobel Peace Prize winning husband, Lech Walesa, served as the country's first democratically elected president in the 1980s. Danuta tells Outlook's Lucy Ash about the loneliness and domestic grind she faced as her husband rose to power and how her family life was sacrificed to politics. And Radioman, the former homeless man whose obsession with the movies has put him on first name terms with dozens of Hollywood stars. Over the last 20 years he's been an extra in hundreds of films. Now in his early 60s, a documentary has been made about Radioman's walk of fame. Image: Danuta (L) and Lech Walesa (R). Credit: AFP/Getty Show less
