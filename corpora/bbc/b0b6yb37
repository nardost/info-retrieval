Ursula Le Guin's idea of the forest is explored by philosopher and Green party politician Rupert Read and novelist Zen Cho. Plus Matthew Sweet talks to Ian Hislop about this year's winner of the Paul Foot Award for Investigative Journalism. And, for Radio 3's 'Into the Forest' we ask Tom Stoneham, an expert of the philosopher George Berkeley, whether, if a tree falls in the wood and nobody is around, it makes a sound. Usula Le Guin (1929 - 2018) published her science fiction novella The Word for World Is Forest in 1972. In midsummer week, Radio 3 enters one of the most potent sources of the human imagination. 'Into the Forest' explores the enchantment, escape and magical danger of the forest in summer, with slow radio moments featuring the sounds of the forest, allowing time out from today's often frenetic world.
