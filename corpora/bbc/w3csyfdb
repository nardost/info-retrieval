For today's Remembrance edition of the programme, Outlook is re-visiting some remarkable stories of war, its impact on people's lives and the love that can transcend it. Keiko and Rex Ziak, are a married couple whose home nations were on opposite sides in World War II, and who - in their own way - are trying to bring peace to families on either side. Rex is American, and Keiko is Japanese. They have made it their mission to reunite families with Good Luck Flags belonging to fallen Japanese soldiers, and have spent the last ten years looking for good luck flags and returning them to their Japanese homes. So far, they've located more than 700 and have returned over 200 flags through the OBON Society that they set up. They spoke to Outlookâ€™s Jo Fidgen in 2018. Private Wojtek of the 22nd Artillery Transport Division of the Polish Armed Forces was a Syrian brown bear. Fighting alongside him was a teenage soldier called Wojciech Narebski. Now in his 90s, Wojciech recalls the bond that formed between the bear and the other troops. He spoke to Jo last year. What happens to love in a time of war? Waad and Hamza al-Khateab met in Aleppo just as the Syrian conflict was starting, and brought up their baby with the city under siege. They told their story to Jo in May this year.
