Taban Shoresh was just four years old when she was arrested by Saddam Hussein's soldiers and faced almost certain death. She'd been targeted along with other family members because her father was a prominent Kurdish activist, leading opposition to the Iraqi dictator. Nowadays Taban lives and works in London, but she was born in 1982 in the Kurdish city of Erbil. It was a time when Saddam's soldiers were subjecting the Kurdish people to interrogation, mass deportations and executions. She tells Matthew Bannister her extraordinary story.
