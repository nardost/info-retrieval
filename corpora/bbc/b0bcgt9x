"Suddenly this light comes into your life" - says Hanif Kureishi, referring to his hero, his great life, David Bowie. Hanif, an author, screenwriter and film maker went on to become friends with Bowie in the 1990's after they worked together when Bowie wrote the soundtrack to Kureishi's TV adaptation 'The Buddha of Suburbia'. For Hanif it was also David Bowie who inspired him to become an author and filmmaker - he says for a "mixed race Pakistani kid living in a crummy terrace bored out of my mind, I wanted to get out - I wanted to explore, I wanted to express myself, I wanted to be free". Hanif gives his personal insight into the life of David Bowie; the expert witness is Dylan Jones - author of 'David Bowie A Life' and 'When Ziggy Played Guitar'. The presenter is Matthew Parris and the producer is Perminder Khatkar. Show less
