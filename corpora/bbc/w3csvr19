Saúl "Cassandro" Armendáriz is one of the biggest stars of the Mexican Lucha Libre wrestling circuit. He's known as an "exotico", which means he dresses and fights in drag. Saúl had a troubled childhood but found his fix in the wrestling ring and the flamboyant costumes that come with it. Hak-Min Kim has always been obsessed with electronic gadgets, so much so that his neighbours in North Korea called him "Repair Boy". But when he found himself alone and unable to feed himself, he realised it was more than electronics that needed fixing.
