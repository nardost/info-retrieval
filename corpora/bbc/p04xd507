Alejandro Hernandez Cardenas is a forensic odontologist working in the Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez. He helps identify bodies through their dental records, but he's taken his work a step further by developing a special formula to rehydrate corpses, in order to reveal any lesions or birth marks that might help to identify them. Outlook's Irene Caselli reports with the support of the International Womenâ€™s Media Foundation. Neil Hilborn is an American spoken word artist who suffers from both Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. But Neil uses this as inspiration for his work.
