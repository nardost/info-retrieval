Asma Jahangir was a remarkable human rights campaigner, who died of a heart attack at the weekend. In her long career as a lawyer and women's rights activist, she was never afraid to take on anyone, no matter how powerful. She tells Jo Fidgen what drove her to become a lawyer in the first place. Fights between rival schools are a major problem in Jakarta. They've been around for decades, but recently they've become even more violent. 130 children have died in the last six years. Arif Rahman used to fight himself, but now he's trying to stop the violence. Steven Bradbury is an Australian speed skater who became a controversial winner at the Winter Olympics. He survived a late wipe out in which three of his competitors toppled, allowing him to clinch victory against all the odds. Correction: US skater Apolo Ohno is an eight-time Olympic medallist, not an eight-time Gold Olympic medallist. (Picture: Asma Jahangir. Photo credit: Jean-Piere Muller/AFP/Getty Images.) Show less
