Former Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill from Butte, Montana served on more than 400 missions. It was in 2011 though that he took part in the biggest mission of his career and the biggest in the history of the US Navy SEALS. He is the man who believes he killed America's most wanted man at the time, Osama Bin Laden. Robert has written a book on the subject called 'The Operator'. He spoke to Outlook's Anu Anand. By profession Sarah Hay is a deputy head teacher, but in her heart she's a medieval knight, currently the world's number one ranked female jouster. In the Danish capital Copenhagen tourists flock to Assistens Cemetery to see the graves of famous people including children's author Hans Christian Andersen. Now thanks to social worker Michael Espensen, alongside the household names, you'll also find the graves of homeless people.
