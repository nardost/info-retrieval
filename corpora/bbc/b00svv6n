On Last Word this week: Novelist Beryl Bainbridge. Two Conservative politicians who were on opposite wings of the party: the one nation Tory Lord Walker who survived in Margaret Thatcher's cabinet despite disagreeing with her on many policies and Dame Angela Rumbold, the strong Eurosceptic who tried to advance the cause of women in the party. Professor Sir Hugh Ford: the engineer who made major break-throughs in plastics and metals which fuelled the growth of British manufacturing after the war. And Robert Byrd: the longest serving American senator. Repeat - first broadcast on Friday, 2, July, 2010. Show less
