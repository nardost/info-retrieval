JEHAN SADAT Egypt's former First Lady talks about her strict English mother, her romantic husband, their many happy years together and the horror of his assassination - when he was gunned down, she was only yards away. She tells Lucy Ash about her life fighting for women's rights in Egypt. CAVE PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN Since the early 90s, many refugees fleeing the violence in Afghanistan have found sanctuary in the Hazarajat region in the centre of the country. This is the area where the two monumental statues of standing Buddhas once stood before they were destroyed by the Taleban. With no place to go and little money, the refugees were forced to join others living in the caves surrounding the statues. It was only meant to be temporary accommodation but as the BBC's Imran Ali reports, many families are still living in the caves today. ABRAMZ TEKYA Abramz Tekya is a young Ugandan man who's using Hip Hop, Rap music and break dancing to improve the lives of disadvantaged youth in his country. He lost both his parents to Aids when he was just 7 years old. He and his sister and two brothers were then left to fend more or less for themselves but, as he tells Lucy Ash, his love of music and his desire to help others has offered him a way out of the slums.
