Listening Post is a new series that invites close, unhurried listening to the stories of individuals and the histories they carry with them. Philip McTaggart lives in the shadow of his son's suicide. Also called Philip – and nicknamed Pip – he was just 17 when he died. His father's response, in 2003, was to set up the Public Initiative for the Prevention of Suicide and Self-Harm, or PIPS. We hear how the trauma of Pip's suicide led Philip to an awareness of the alarming rates of suicide and self-harm among young people in Northern Ireland. Show less
