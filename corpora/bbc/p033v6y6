When doctor Zizit Abdel Algabbar was trying to get from Syria to Europe with her baby daughter Maya, the two became separated during the journey and Zizit was not sure if she would ever see her little girl again. She had no papers and no money left, but, as she tells Jo Fidgen, she was finally reunited with her daughter. For four years, Welsh musician Claire Jones was the Official Harpist to Prince Charles. Her duties included playing at the wedding reception of his son William, to Kate Middleton - now the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Claire is now recovering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, known as ME. She tells Nicki Paxman why she is grateful for being able to continue to play her harp. Spanish priest Father Angel is embracing technology to transform his 18th century church into a very 21st century place of worship. The San Anton church is 250 years old, but Father Angel is determined to make it as fashionable as its neighbours in the trendy Chueca area of Madrid. The BBC's Rafael Estefania goes to meet him and hear his story. Hiromi Yasui has been living in Afghanistan for fourteen years, having first visited the country as a young photographer in 1993. She was interested in meeting a nomadic tribe that she'd read about - but the country was in the middle of a civil war, and her attention was diverted. The experience turned her into a war reporter - which had a certain irony, as she'd pretended to be a journalist in order to get a visa. As she tells Jo Fidgen, she's now the owner of the only Japanese restaurant in Afghanistan. (Picture: Zizit Abdel Algabbar with daughter Maya Picture credit: Eva Bartussek) Show less
