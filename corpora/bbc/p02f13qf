After the UN warned that the world had just 60 days to get the Ebola virus under control, Dr John Wright joined a team of British medics setting up a treatment centre in a remote part of Sierra Leone. In this audio diary for the BBC, he details the highs and lows ahead of the planned opening on Friday, 19th December. The Cuban born conductor and composer Odaline de la Martinez is something of a pioneer in contemporary classical music. She has made her home in the UK and was the first woman to conduct at the famous BBC Proms concerts in London. But her Cuban roots continue to inform her music. Odaline has just celebrated her 65th birthday with the premiere of the second part of her opera trilogy The Crossing, about the slave trade in Cuba in the 1500s. John Cleese is a British comedian who first found fame in the 1970s as part of Monty Python, the surreal TV sketch show which became a hit around the world. He went on to create and star in Fawlty Towers, a sitcom set in a seaside hotel. Now aged 75, John Cleese has just published his autobiography So Anyway.
