Last Broadcast Date: Mon 15 Sep 2014
Peter Watkins' film Culloden is 50, and in front of an audience at the Edinburgh Festival, Matthew Sweet discusses its influence on portrayals of Scotland's Highland identity in book and film with Diana Gabaldon, author of the best-selling Outlander series, historian Tom Devine and media expert John Cook. They'll explore how Culloden was received in 1964 and the way it gave birth to the television form of docu-drama and shaped the early development of Dr Who. Matthew Sweet will also be asking why the emotional imagining of Culloden as National Shrine has proved so difficult to break down despite the best efforts of Scotland's historians and heritage industry and whether Scotland's misty myths will ever be redrawn in the global consciousness.
