Millions of people in Nepal have had their lives turned upside down by last week's earthquake, including journalist Bhrikuti Rai who was at her home in Kathmandu when the quake struck. She sent us this diary of the dramatic events. Growing up in China, Jia Jiang dreamed of moving to America and becoming a rich entrepreneur like his hero the Microsoft founder Bill Gates. However he found his fear of failure was preventing him from achieving his goals, so he took a radical course of action to seek out rejection in order to overcome it. When she was pregnant with her first child, Sesa Abu Daooh's husband died and she was left without an income. Living in rural Egypt where few women work, Sesa decided to disguise herself as a man so she could provide for her young daughter. Over 40 years later, Sesa is still the main breadwinner for the family. She was recently awarded a prize for being an 'Ideal Mother'.
