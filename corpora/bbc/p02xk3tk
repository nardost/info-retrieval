Choman Hardi was born in Iraqi Kurdistan, but spent her entire childhood on the move because of conflict. At 19 she moved to England where she was granted refugee status and began writing poetry while studying at university but in the past year has moved back to Northern Iraq, teaching literature at the American University there. Her poems explore statelessness, genocide and the eternal battle of Kurdish identity.
