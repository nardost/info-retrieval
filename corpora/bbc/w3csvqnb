Claudette Colvin is one of the unsung heroes of the American civil rights movement. As a teenager, Claudette refused to give up her seat on a bus for a white passenger. Nine months later, when Rosa Parks did the same thing, she inspired a revolution. So why wasn't Claudette recognised? She talks to Matthew Bannister about her extraordinary life. In January, a passenger train collided with a truck in the Free State Province in South Africa, killing 21 people. But during this tragedy, two remarkable heroes emerged. They are both 12 years old and are now gaining national recognition. Outlook's Mpho Lakaje has been talking to the boys. British police officer Dave Wardell and his dog Finn were a successful crime fighting duo. Together they are responsible for over 200 arrests and the recovery of thousands of pounds' worth of stolen goods and money. But after Finn was stabbed while saving Dave's life, they've also become social media stars. Some of the details of the incident are distressing. If you go to a concert by a major hip hop star in the United States, you might see a man standing on the stage, furiously interpreting the lyrics through sign language. That man is Matt Maxey. He's not the only one who does the job but some of the biggest stars ask for him. Matt was born with profound hearing loss, and has used hearing aids for most of his life.
