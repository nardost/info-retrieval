Claudia di Maggio from Sydney has always known that her mum, Antonietta, would do anything for her. When she found out she would only be able to have a baby through a surrogate Antonietta stepped in, volunteering to give birth to her own grandson. In 1975 PK Mahanandia was an impoverished art student in Delhi making a bit of cash by sketching tourists. One day he met a young Swedish tourist called Lotta von Schedvin. A year later, he cycled 7,000 miles to Sweden to be reunited with her.
