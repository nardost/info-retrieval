Post referendum, Anne McElvoy is joined by Kwasi Kwarteng MP for Spelthorne who made the case for Brexit; Dr Uta Staiger, Deputy Director of the European Institute at University College London; Sunder Katwala, the Director of the Think Tank, British Future; and, Abigail Green, Professor of European History at the University of Oxford discuss the competing histories behind Britain's decision to leave the European Union. And we're joined by one of our 2016 New Generation Thinkers, Chris Kissane, who discusses our ideas of citizenship. Plus Dr Matthew Wall from Swansea University shares his research into betting patterns and what they tell us about the referendum. Chris Kissane researches early modern history, food and history, economic and social history at the London School of Economics. The New Generation Thinkers prize is an initiative launched by BBC Radio 3 and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) to find the brightest minds from across the UK who have the potential to transform their research into engaging broadcast programmes.
