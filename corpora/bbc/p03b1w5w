Stories of dreamers who wouldn't take no for an answer. Isaac Nabwana's films feature car chases, choreographed fight scenes and special effects but they are made on a shoestring budget. When Alan Hofmanis, a movie buff from New York, heard about Isaac he was inspired to move to Uganda to work on his films. Sergey Ananov is a Russian pilot who was attempting to become the first person to fly around the world in a light helicopter, weighing less than one tonne. But the record journey went dramatically wrong near the Arctic Circle, and he had to ditch into the ice cold sea just off Baffin Island in Canada. Despite having no formal training and only basic tools and materials to work with, 23-year-old George Mel from Juba, in South Sudan, has constructed a petrol powered aircraft in his garden. And Afghan MP Shukria Barakzai was the target of a suicide bombing last year. But she was recently a member of the all female delegation that had a historic meeting with members of the Taliban in Norway.
