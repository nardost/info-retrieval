Personal stories behind the news from all over the world. With Matthew Bannister. On today's programme: bereaved parents for peace; '89 voices in Hungary; US amputees help each other. Circle of Bereaved Parents Israeli Rami Elhanan and Palestinian Bassam Aramin have both lost daughters in the conflict between their peoples. But instead of demanding revenge, they are working together for peace and reconciliation. Rami and Bassam are part of a 500 strong group called The Circle of Bereaved Parents. Their stories are told in a book called "Nine Lives." 89 Voices Today we have the second part of our series "89 Voices" in which we hear from people born in different parts of Eastern Europe in 1989 - the year that Communism came to an end. Miklos Kerekfy is a student in Budapest who was born in 1989, the year that Hungary made a pledge to end Communist rule. US Amputees Jane O'Brien hears about a scheme in the United States in which amputees from the Vietnam war help US soldiers who've lost limbs in Iraq and Afghanistan. Jo Beimfohr lost both legs in a roadside bombing in Iraq in 2005. During his treatment he was visited by Jack Farley, a Vietnam War veteran who lost one of his legs in a mortar explosion. Show less
