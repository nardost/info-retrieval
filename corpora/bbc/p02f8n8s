Walter Mischel’s celebrated Marshmallow Test, designed to explore our ability to exercise self-control, has come of age. Data from the 1960s experiment coupled with new brain scan technology has revealed just how central our ability to wait for things can be. Now 21st Century gaming technology seeks to use what psychologists and neurologists have learnt since the test’s creation to design games with increasingly sophisticated elements. Quentin Cooper discusses the issue of restraint with Walter Mischel, neurologist Lesley Fellows and games designer Mitu Khandaker-Kokoris. (Photo: Macaroons. Credit: Getty Images) Show less
