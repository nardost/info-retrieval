Rob Scheer grew up in foster care after suffering abuse from his parents. After he left care he founded the charity Comfort Cases which has now helped more than 25,000 foster children in America by offering comfort and support and essentials like new pyjamas and blankets. Indira Lacerna-Widmann has made it her mission to protect the endangered Philippine cockatoo and has enlisted the help of some unlikely volunteers. She has been working with prisoners in the Palawan province to locate and look after the rare birds as well as helping the prisoners to adjust to life outside of prison. Wanda Diaz Merced is an astrophysicist from Puerto Rico. Unlike most people in the line of work Wanda is blind but has found a way of being able to collect and study data from the stars and space. Wanda uses a technique called sonification which changes visual data into sound waves allowing Wanda to hear the sounds of the stars. In the run up to BBC Music Day we hear from Japanese rock star and founder of band X Japan, Yoshiki. Many events in Yoshiki's life have influenced the music the band has created. They play rock music but classical music has also had a big impact on him throughout his life. Image: Rob Scheer Credit: Rob Scheer Show less
