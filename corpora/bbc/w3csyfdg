Lual Mayen was born in what is now South Sudan but his family had to flee from conflict in 1993. They made it to Uganda and set up home in a refugee camp. It was here that Lual discovered computers - and computer games. He created one called Salaam that focused on peace and empathy rather than violence, something his family had experienced in real life. It started attracting attention worldwide and last year it won the Global Gaming Citizen award. Cambodia's biggest rubbish dump was home to thousands of children, picking through rubbish to sell. From this bleak wasteland emerged a band, Doch Chkae - young musicians who grew up in extreme poverty, turning their anger into heavy metal music. Harry Graham speaks to two of the band members, Sok Vichey and Ouch Theara. We also hear from one of the charity workers who spotted their talent for metal music, Timon Seibel, from Moms Against Poverty. Show less
