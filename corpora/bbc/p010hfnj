Chloe Aridjis is the daughter of a Mexican poet and diplomat, and an American environmental activist. Her first novel, Book of Clouds, was published in 2009 and won the Prix du Premier Roman Etranger in France that year. Her second novel, Asunder, will be published in May 2013. As an adolescent, her bilingual exposure to pop took place in Mexico City, where she listened to British bands whilst going to a gay Goth club and discovering the Mexican equivalents.
