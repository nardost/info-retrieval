A year ago today, two Islamist gunmen stormed into the editorial meeting of the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo and shot 11 people dead. They also killed a policeman in the street. Journalist Philippe Lancon was hit in the face, hands and arm - but somehow survived. He's been re-living his terrifying experience for Outlook. When storm clouds gather in the sky, most people run for cover. But the American pilot Steffany Royal jumps in her car and heads to the nearest runway. As a member of a weather modification team, her job is to fly into the storm and seed the clouds with a chemical to encourage rain in an area of drought or even suppress hail in order to protect crops for farmers. When the financial crisis hit Greece in 2009, many people lost their jobs and had their savings wiped out. Some lost their homes and ended up on the streets. One of those affected was Konstantinos Polychronopoulos who lives in Athens. But now, he's found a new way of helping those in need and restoring his own self respect. Jyotsna Srikanth is an acclaimed Indian violinist. But she originally trained as a pathologist - and only felt able to give up her day job in 2007 when she was invited to play at the prestigious BBC Proms music festival in London. She plays in the Carnatic classical tradition - a system of music usually associated with the southern part of the Indian subcontinent. Recently she performed before thousands of people at Wembley football stadium in honour of the visit to London of the Indian Prime Minister. (Photo: Philippe Lancon.
