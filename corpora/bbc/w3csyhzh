Andrew Garrido was desperate to play the piano but lessons were expensive and his family couldn't afford them. Andrew, undeterred, made a keyboard out of paper and taught himself. A decade later and what he's achieved defies all expectations. Additional playing in this piece was by Duncan Hannant. Denise Uwimana was nine months pregnant when the Rwandan genocide started. As militia broke into her home and attacked her relatives, Denise's waters broke; her baby was coming. She tells Asya Fouks her birth story and how she survived. Denise has written about her experiences in a book called From Red Earth: A Rwandan Story of Healing and Forgiveness. Picture: Andrew Garrido with his paper piano Credit: Alice Gioia Show less
