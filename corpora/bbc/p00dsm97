LAWILL CONCY Lawill Concy is 42 and married to a church warden in Gulu in Uganda. Ten years ago she fell into the hands of the Lord's Resistance Army rebel group, which has long been terrorising northern Uganda and neighbouring countries. Its members are feared for their sheer brutality: they have abducted 60,000 Ugandan children, sometimes forcing them to kill their own parents. And they frequently mutilate the people they capture. Many of those who suffer disfigurement hide away, but Lawill has chosen to tell our reporter, Mike Thomson, the shocking story of what happened to her. JUNE SCOBEE RODGERS 25 years ago millions of television viewers across the world watched, horrified, as the Challenger space shuttle exploded little more than a minute after taking off from Cape Canaveral in Florida. There were seven crew on board, including a school teacher. This was the first time the US had lost astronauts in flight, and it was a profound loss for the country. The Commander of the Challenger was Dick Scobee; his widow June witnessed the disaster as it unfolded. June Scobee Rodgers' book Silver Linings - My Life Before and After Challenger 7 - is out now.
