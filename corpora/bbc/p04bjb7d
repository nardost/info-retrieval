Dr Maher Saqqur is originally from Syria, but now lives in Canada. Even though he is thousands of miles away he treats patients in Aleppo via video link. Levi Bettweiser from the American city of Boise is on a photographic mission. He tells us how he has "rescued" over 18,000 images from forgotten rolls of film by trawling the internet and second hand shops for old cameras that have undeveloped photographs inside them. Flying upside down is run-of-the-mill for Australian aerobatic pilot Joel Haski, but he tells us why he is planning to do it for hours on end as he flies from Perth to Sydney. Christine Kamau speaks to Outlook reporter Andrea Kidd about being the the only female jazz trumpeter in Kenya, and describes how she fell in love with the trumpet when she was a teenager.
