As a teenager Winnie Byanyima fled to the UK, escaping from the repressive regime of Idi Amin in her native Uganda. She arrived with 300 dollars in cash - which turned out to be fake. But Winnie didn't let that stop her. She graduated in aeronautical engineering - went back to Uganda to join the resistance - and ended up as an MP. After working with the African Union and the United Nations, she's now become the first African director of the charity Oxfam. "Lucian" is a homeless man from Romania who won the lottery in Sweden. Two months ago he was begging and living on the streets. Then he bought a scratch card and won a car. He was able to trade it in for 210,000 Swedish Krone - about 25,000 US dollars - in cash. And now he's moved back to Romania to rejoin his family. Sister Rosemary Nyirumbe is a Catholic nun who supports girls who were victims of the Lord's Resistance Army, which terrorised the people of northern Uganda for over 20 years. Sister Rosemary restores the girls' self esteem and gives them a career by teaching them sewing at the Saint Monica Girls' Tailoring Centre in Gulu, Uganda. George Mel from South Sudan has built a plane in his backyard. Despite having no formal training and only basic tools and materials to work with, 23 year old George has constructed a petrol powered aircraft that he calls the "Ultralight". He also builds drones.
