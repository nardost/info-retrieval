Dr David Nott is one of the top vascular surgeons in London. And for 23 years he has been taking unpaid leave from his job to perform surgery, and train surgeons, in parts of the world where there is a desperate need. He has worked in war zones and scenes of natural disasters in Syria, Afghanistan, Gaza, Nepal and Haiti among others. Paula and Bridgette Powers are identical twins from eastern Australia, who have spent almost every day of their lives together. They even choose to speak at the same time. The pair, now in their 40s, also share a passion for seabirds, and have set up the Twinnies Pelican and Seabird Rescue refuge off the Sunshine Coast. Pablo Larrain is an internationally acclaimed film-maker from Chile. His latest movie, The Club, is a fictional account of four former Catholic priests who live together in hiding in a house run by a vigilant nun. (Photo: David Nott with kind permission from D.
