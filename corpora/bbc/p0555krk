Dr Mounir Hakimi comes from Homs in Syria but moved to the UK fourteen years ago to work as a surgeon. For the last few years he's been travelling back and forth to Syria whenever he can take time off to treat those wounded in the ongoing conflict there. Recently however he was needed much closer to home when a suicide bomber targeted a concert just down the road from where he lives in Manchester killing 22 people. Ahead of BBC music day we hear from Ramin Bahrami. When Ramin heard a piece of music by the composer JS Bach at the age of five, his life was transformed. His passion for music led him from his birth country to Italy, where he built a reputation as one of the most innovative interpreters of Bach's work. Ronnie O'Sullivan is a superstar in the world of snooker having won the world championship five times. Ronnie has had a very dramatic life and has witten a thriller novel called Framed set in the part of London where he grew up - Soho, famous for its sex shops, late night bars and seedy characters. His own dad ran a pornographic magazine business and went to jail for murder. Image: Dr Mounir Hakimi at work Credit: Mounir Hakimi Show less
