Throughout history people have held conspiracy theories which cast doubt on the official narratives of some very serious events - from the Holocaust to 9/11, Diana to JFK, Lockerbie to Sandy Hook. What prompts people to think in this way? How should governments react to the people who doubt them? Or, are they in fact critical in our attempts to hold governments to account? Mike Williams talks to a psychologist, a professor of Political Science and a conspiracy theorist as he attempts to separate fact from fiction.
