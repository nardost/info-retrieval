Laurens de Groot was a policeman in the Netherlands but gave up his career to become an activist, chasing down whale hunters in Antarctica. Jo Fidgen finds out what made him swap his life enforcing the law to participating in activities that could lead to a confrontation with the law. British actor Mat Fraser was born with shortened arms after his mother took Thalidomide during her pregnancy. Now he and his wife-to-be, the American burlesque star Julie Atlas Muz, have created a show called Beauty and the Beast. Kirsty Lang asks how their collaboration came about. The Tower of David is the nickname for a 45-storey skyscraper in Caracas, famous as the world's tallest slum. But what is it like to live there? Irene Caselli meets one of the tower's 3000 inhabitants.
