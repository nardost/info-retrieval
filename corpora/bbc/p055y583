Indian Ayisha Falaq has been called a hero after saving her brother-in-law who had been taken hostage. Little did the captors know they were facing an award-winning shooter. Tshiamo Legoale is a young South African geologist who has just been awarded a top scientific prize for her research into growing gold from wheat. Dr Rebekah McCurdy is a obstetrician for humans. But she found herself at Philadelphia Zoo, helping a gorilla give birth. Kerri and Luke Fox are a couple who met while riding motorbikes around a 20ft high vertical wooden cylinder known as a 'wall of death.' Image and credit: Ayisha Falaq Show less
