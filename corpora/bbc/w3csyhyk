Maria Grette ignored most of the messages she received from men on her online dating profile. But there was one that she felt a connection to. He was a Danish-American businessman, handsome and living in South Carolina in the USA. They spoke daily, and as their relationship intensified 'Johnny' made plans to visit Maria in Sweden. But then an horrific incident, a phone-call and demands for money. 'Johnny's' identity began to unravel. Emily Webb hears her story. French inventor Franky Zapata always wanted to fly. He tried to get his pilot's license, but colour-blindness meant he failed the test. So he found another way. He headed into his workshop with a brainwave about jet-skis. Two months later, he'd invented his very own hover-board. He recently flew it over France's Bastille Day celebrations, and this week he'll attempt to hover over the entire English Channel. Franky spoke to Outlook back in 2016. Dr Rulon Clark grew up loving snakes - but is behind the recent viral videos of amazing rats. Along with colleagues at the San Diego State University, he's been filming rats taking on venomous snakes in the Arizona desert. Who wins? The clue is in the rodent's new nickname: 'Ninja rat'.
