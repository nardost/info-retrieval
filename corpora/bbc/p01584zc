Iraqi cardiologist Firas al Kubaisy describes the serious levels of congenital heart defects in and around Fallujah, and his feelings on carrying out his first hole in the heart operation. Also, following the news that Hugo Chavez of Venezuela will join the ranks of former world leaders who have been embalmed for display, we talk to Frank Malabed, an embalmer from Manila who embalmed the body of Ferdinand Marcos, the former President of the Philippines. And Will Moult, the young British man who was adopted as a baby from a Romanian orphanage, recalls tracking down his birth mother.
