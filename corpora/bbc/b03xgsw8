On Last Word with Julian Worricker: Two prominent figures of the political left, Tony Benn and Bob Crow. Ruth Winstone, who edited Tony Benn's diaries for publication, pays tribute to the former Cabinet minister and Labour MP. And you'll hear from a close colleague of the general secretary of the RMT union and from a man who was critical of him in print but who says privately you couldn't meet a nicer and more sincere bloke. The actor, James Ellis, who portrayed Bert Lynch in 'Z Cars' for sixteen years. Sir Kenneth Branagh recalls how James helped launch his career. The oceanographer, Doctor Peter Rona, who helped to pioneer the scientific exploration of the deep-sea floor. And the pianist, Marion Thorpe, who co-founded the Leeds International Piano Competition.
