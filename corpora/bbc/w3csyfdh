British footballer Mark Bright spent his childhood in foster care. Though he was well looked after, no one told him they loved him until he was 18. Meanwhile, he was becoming a star striker and his heyday was at Crystal Palace. He's just published his autobiography, Mark Bright – My Story – From Foster Care to Footballer. It's six years this month since the passing of Nelson Mandela, former President of South Africa. Our reporter in South Africa, Mpho Lakaje, has been speaking to the woman who knew him best in those final years, his third wife - and former first lady of Mozambique - Graca Machel. Next stop, we’re in Lijiang, a small farming village on the shores of Lugu Lake in southwest China, where popular folk musician Guro-duoji is on a mission. He's part of a minority group - the Moso - who are fighting for their language, Naru, and their culture, surrounded as they are by Han Chinese language and culture. Guro-duoji spoke to reporter Christina Ayele Djossa and the associate producer was Tami Blumenfield. Support for this story was provided by the International Women's Media Fund (IWMF) through the Kim Wall Memorial Fund. Picture: Mark Bright after scoring a goal for Crystal Palace in 1991.
