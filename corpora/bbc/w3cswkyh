Fabiola Hernández Guevara from Colombia lost her first husband Libardo in 1985 when he was killed during a siege. After his death, she took some comfort in visiting his grave. That was until she discovered it was not his remains buried there, but those of the people who killed him. She tells reporter Dimitri O'Donnell her story. Glenn Sorino is known as the Pied Piper of Parrots. If you have a problem with your macaw or your cockatoo - and you happen to live in New York - Glenn is the man you need. Colm Flynn has been to meet him. There’s a man in Fiji who Hollywood executives call when they want to find Pacific Islander voices for their movies. He’s called Igelese Ete, and his day job is Head of Performing Arts at the University of the South Pacific in Suva. He was born in Samoa, moved to New Zealand as a boy, and has set up choirs for Pacific singers wherever he goes. He tells Outlook's Jo Fidgen how his choir ended up performing in the Disney film "Moana". Image: Fabiola Hernández Guevara Credit: Dimitri O'Donnell Show less
