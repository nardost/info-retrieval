Ghulam Ullah is an Afghan man who has devoted his life to recovering the bodies of people who have drowned in the mighty Kunar River. It all started 38 years ago, when he tried to save two of his friends from the water. Since then, he has recovered over 500 bodies, without any modern equipment. Saba Douglas-Hamilton is a wildlife conservationist and TV presenter, who was born and brought up largely in Kenya. Her father Iain, is one of the foremost elephant experts in the world. And Sab has continued her parents' work to protect elephants in Africa. Most recently she and her young family have moved to the Samburu National Park in northern Kenya, to run an elephant safari camp. Joyce Akumaa Dongotey-Padi, or Akumaa Mama Zimbi to her fans in Ghana, is a woman who has nearly as many jobs as she has names. She is a radio and TV presenter, agony aunt, self-styled relationships expert, philanthropist and the director of her own charity, the Mama Zimbi Foundation. Palm Island is a small island to the north of Queensland. It is one of the places where, back in the early 1900s, the Australian government dispersed Aboriginal people for what they called 'protection' while taking over their land. In their play Beautiful One Day, Australia's leading Aboriginal theatre company, Ilbijerri, tells the story of the history of oppression on the island. Felicity Finch met three of the island's residents who were nominated by their community to take part in the production. As migrants continue to cross the Mediterranean, some unusual neighbours have been getting to know each other. In one camp outside Belgrade in Serbia, refugees from the conflict in the Balkans of the 1990s have found themselves living alongside migrants arriving from the Middle East and Africa.
