Saúl "Cassandro" Armendáriz is one of the biggest stars of the Mexican Lucha Libre wrestling circuit. In a sport known for its flamboyant characters and acrobatic moves, Cassandro is one of the most colourful. He's known as an "exotico", which means he dresses in drag, wearing glamorous make up and sequin covered costumes in electric shades. Outlook couldn't resist going to see him in action. Nainoa Thompson from Hawaii is an expert in the traditional Polynesian art of voyaging. He has sailed thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean using only the sun, the stars and the ocean winds to guide him. Nainoa grew up on a dairy farm and his relationship with sea started when one of the dairy workers gave him a bamboo fishing rod. Özlem Cekic is one of the first female Danish MPs. She comes from a Kurdish family and when she became a public figure she was a constant target for online abuse and even death threats. Rather than ignore the hate mails, Özlem decided to go to meet the people who sent them. Emma Lock has an unusual menagerie of animals in her London flat, which includes cockroaches, Madagascan tenrecs and highly poisonous centipedes. Emma makes informative videos of her pets and wants to raise awareness about the challenges and risks of keeping exotic animals in captivity.
