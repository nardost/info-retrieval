In 2011, military lawyer Rebecca Lipe was deployed to Iraq with the US Air Force. Her combat body armour didn’t fit because it was designed for men. She had to adapt it, and ended up with debilitating pain, fertility problems and severe depression. She tells Outlook’s Emily Webb how she’s determined the same won't happen to other women in warzones. Viengsay Valdes is one of Cuba's most prominent ballet dancers. Since 2003, she's been the prima ballerina at Ballet Nacional de Cuba, one of the best ballet companies in the world. This year she was appointed its deputy artistic director. Outlook's Jane Chambers went to meet Viegnsay and some of the other stars of Cuban ballet to find out why dance is so important to them. Photo: Rebecca Lipe Credit: Courtesy of Rebecca Lipe Show less
