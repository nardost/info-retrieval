Matthew Parris presents the biographical series in which his guests choose someone who has inspired their lives. Musician and performer Neil Innes discusses the life of his Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band colleague and friend Vivian Stanshall. Neil recalls the moment he met Vivian Stanshall in London: he was wearing Billy Bunter trousers, a Victorian frock coat and horrible purple pince-nez glasses and carrying a euphonium. So began a friendship and a musical partnership that exploded into life with The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, culminating in tours and TV series. Vivian's second wife, Ki Longfellow, joins the discussion to help explore the man behind the colourful public persona. Show less
