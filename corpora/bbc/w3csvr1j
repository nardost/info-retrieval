Australian Rusty Young was backpacking in Bolivia when he took a tour of San Pedro prison. He was so fascinated by what he saw there that he stayed for four months. Sunny Jacobs from the United States and Peter Pringle from Ireland were both sentenced to death for crimes they had not committed but they ended up meeting and falling in love.
