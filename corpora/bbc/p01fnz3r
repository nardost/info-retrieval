Why do some of us find it easier than others to let go of places, people, the past, or ideas and traditions? Bridget Kendall talks to Bulgarian writer Miroslav Penkov who left his homeland and his native language to seek a new life in the United States; medical doctor and philosopher Raymond Tallis who says to let go of old assumptions, we need to stop thinking too hard, and just walk and look; and Chinese choreographer Xu Rui who is encouraging classically trained Chinese dancers to let go of their strict traditional styles and embrace new moves.
