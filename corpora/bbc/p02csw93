We meet the Australian woman who fell in love with her sperm donor. Aminah Hart had a daughter using a sperm donor, but when she tracked him down, she was not expecting to fall in love with him. But she did and now they are engaged to be married. They speak to Matthew Bannister about their amazing love story. Herizo Andrianandrasana has devoted his life to saving the wildlife of his native Madagascar. He organises local communities to combat the increasing destruction of the country's forests - and tackle the impact that has on the animals and birds that he loves so much. Herizo's work has just won him the Tusk Award for Conservation in Africa. Hayatullah Hayat is an Afghan lawyer who works tirelessly for civil society in his homeland. He tells Matthew about the dangers he faces and why he recently spent his life savings and went into debt to buy an armoured vehicle. Scottish singer songwriter Annie Lennox has sold 80 million records over the course of her career, both as a solo artist and as part of the band The Eurythmics. She has also received an OBE from the Queen for her work as an AIDS campaigner. She tells us about her new album Nostalgia and why she has released it after a four-year-break from the music business.
