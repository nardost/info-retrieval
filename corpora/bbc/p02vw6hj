A sonic tour of the universe, with solar scientist, Dr Lucie Green. In the previous episode, we listened in to the sounds of the Solar System. This week in Discovery, we travel further out into the cosmos to bring you more Sounds of Space. Some are recorded sound, others are data â€“ like X-rays or radio waves - that have been sonified. All of them have inspired scientists and artists to help us understand our universe. Joining Lucie Green on this sonic journey through space are: - Prof Tim O'Brien (Associate Director of Jodrell Bank Observatory) - Honor Harger (Executive Director of the ArtScience museum in Singapore) - Dr Andrew Pontzen (Cosmology Research Group, University College London) Producer: Michelle Martin Image: Whirlpool Galaxy Credit, NASA Hubble Show less
