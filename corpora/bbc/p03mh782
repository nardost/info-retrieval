Stéphane Ebongue from Cameroon has black parents, but he has white skin, white hair and pale eyes. It's all down to albinism, a genetic condition which means he doesn't produce the pigment melanin. Stéphane's appearance means he's faced discrimination which eventually forced him to flee his home. Amir Hussain Lone started helping out at his family's saw mill in Indian-administered Kashmir when he was very young. But when he was eight a horrific accident turned his life upside down and made him question his own worth. As he told Aliya Nazki, it's taken eighteen years and a love of cricket to help him find his place in the world again. Twenty years ago, on the morning of the 13th March 1996, five year old Aimie Adam headed to school as normal in the quiet Scottish town of Dunblane. She and her schoolmates were being taught in the gym when a local man walked in and started shooting. In the space of three minutes Thomas Hamilton murdered sixteen pupils and a teacher before killing himself. Aimie was shot twice. Leslie Pereira is a lawyer from the Indian city of Mumbai, but he spends his free time in the city's hospitals looking for patients who need help. Some just want to talk, while others have been abandoned by their families because of their illnesses. Leslie has recently been nominated as one of Mumbai's City Heroes for his efforts.
