When Doug Lindsay was at university, he got ill very suddenly. It was the same mystery illness his mother and aunt had suffered from for most of their lives. Doctors were baffled. Doug had to drop out of university and was bedridden for years. He decided to take matters into his own hands and work out what was wrong with him. In search of a cure, Doug eventually persuaded doctors to perform a surgery which had never been done on humans before. He spoke to Outlookâ€™s Jo Fidgen.
