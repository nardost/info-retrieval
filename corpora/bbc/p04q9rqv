South African runner Caster Semenya shot to fame in 2009 when she won the 800 metres at the World Championships in Berlin. Her performance was so astonishing that some people wondered if she really was a woman. Now hear the unheard personal story of a great athlete and the controversial matter of her sex. Newly-single Bonnie Kate Pourciau was watching Batman: The Dark Knight Rises at a cinema in Colorado, when a man opened fire, killing 12 people, and wounding 70 including Bonnie Kate. After months in hospital and seven surgeries on her leg Bonnie eventually found her Hollywood happy ending. Noela Rukundo was attending a family funeral in her home country of Burundi when armed men forced her into a car, drove her away, and told her she was going to be killed. Worse still, Noela discovered it was her husband who had paid for this to happen. The men took pity on her, and freed Noela to confront her husband. Image: A bride looks over from behind her veil.
