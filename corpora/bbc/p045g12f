The American songwriter and composer Richard M. Sherman has worked on some of the most enduring and memorable songs in musical film history. In partnership with his brother Robert, he created scores for hits such as The Jungle Book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and won two Oscars for his work on Mary Poppins. The Sherman Brothers worked closely with Walt Disney himself - and wrote what would become his favourite song, Feed the Birds. BBC Outlook's Maryam Maruf has been to meet Richard at his home - in front of his piano - in the American city of Los Angeles. He reflects on a lifetime of extraordinary memories - starting with his grandfather who was a conductor at the court of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to his own father, a Tin Pan Alley composer in New York City, onto his 50 year long collaboration with his brother Robert creating some of Disney's most iconic songs.
