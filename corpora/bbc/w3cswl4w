Gautam Singh came from a tiny and extremely remote village in the Indian state of Jharkhand where the nearest movie theatre was 50km away. However, he was completely in love with Bollywood films. Nothing could stand in the way of Gautam's obsession and he vowed that one day that he would be the one making the films that he adored. British archivist Will Prentice is so passionate about sounds that he's spent the last 18 years trying to rescue one of the biggest collections of sounds in the world. He works at the British Library Sound Archive, which contains sounds from wildlife recordings to music and interviews. The earliest recordings are from the 1880s and are saved on formats that are decaying or can't be played anymore, like wax cylinders and old vinyl. Will and his team are racing against time to turn them into digital items. A heart-warming photograph of Chadian conservationist Appolinaire Ndohoudou and a baby gorilla called Pikin won a top prize at this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. Outlook's Saskia Edwards finds out the story behind the image, which is both touching and tragic. Image: Gautam Singh on the set of his Bollywood-style film Credit: Gautam Singh Show less
