When Tom Michell came across a penguin caught in an oil spill in Uruguay in the 1970s, he decided to rescue it, clean it and release it back into the wild. But the penguin had no intention of leaving, and Tom ended up adopting it and smuggling it back to his home in Argentina. Marcio "Cromado" Barbosa founded the Renovação Fight Team in Rio and trains some of Brazil's best MMA fighters. 'Jane' is an American Air Force airman who has flown in every major conflict since the first Gulf War. She was brought up as a boy, and her colleagues still regard her as male, but off base she has secretly been transitioning to female. Rules banning trans people in the military have been lifted, but Jane is still forced to keep her gender a secret, fearing for her job. Nia Vardalos wrote and starred in the biggest grossing romantic comedy of all time. My Big Fat Greek Wedding told the true - and hilarious - story of Nia introducing her non-Greek fiancé into her large, eccentric and at times overbearing family.
