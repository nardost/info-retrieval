Landscape architect Charles Jencks calls for a new cosmic art, in a talk entitled Reclaiming the Universe, given at the BBC Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival 2011. Charles Jencks is the visionary designer, theorist and landscape architect whose work includes gardens at the Maggie's Cancer Caring Centres, founded by his late wife Maggie Jencks. He is creating the world's largest sculpture of a human form, Northumberlandia, near the village of Cramlington in the North East. Jencks argues that understanding the universe is too important to be left to scientists and theologians, and wants us to connect to pre-historic ideas about the cosmos, present in monuments such as Stonehenge. This event is recorded in front of a live audience at The Sage Gateshead as part of the 2011 Free Thinking Festival. Presented by Rana Miter. Show less
