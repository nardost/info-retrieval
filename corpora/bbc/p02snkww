Ahmed al-Basheer is Iraq's top satirist. He broadcasts his hugely successful Al Basheer Show from Jordan - poking fun at Iraq's political leaders and Islamic State extremists. He tells Jo Fidgen about leaving Iraq because of the extreme danger - he lost his own father and brother to the violence, and was himself kidnapped for 40 days. Claudio Jimenez Quispe - a Peruvian retablo artist talks about the politics behind his unique craft. Halima Naigembe - a former sex worker from Uganda, who's now set up an organisation helping other women escape the sex trade. Plus, Greg Long - the American surfer who almost died riding a giant wave in the Pacific Ocean. (Photo: Ahmed al-Basheer on the Al-Basheer Show. Credit: Al-Basheer Show) Show less
