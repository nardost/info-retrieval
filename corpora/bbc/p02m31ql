Quentin Cooper is joined by three people who, each in their own way, has set out to capture light in order to exploit and explore some of its remarkable properties. Genevieve Gariepy is taking snapshots of photons, light particles which move at 300 thousand kilometres per second, photographer Benedikt Partenheimer records images that highlight the effects of dense air pollution on light, and professor Ken Durose is attempting to help us get much better at extracting electricity from sunlight.
