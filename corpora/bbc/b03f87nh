When Lindisfarne monastery was attacked in 793AD the monk Alcuin described the church of St Cuthbert, "splattered with the blood of the priests." New Generation Thinker Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough, from Durham University, takes this moment as the starting point for an exploration of the power battles between Vikings and Anglo Saxons which led to the symbolic battles of 1066. New Generation Thinkers are the winners of a talent scheme run by BBC Radio 3 and the Arts and Humanities Research Council to find the brightest academic minds with the potential to turn their ideas into radio broadcasts.
