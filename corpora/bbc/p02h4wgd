Jose Mujica was elected as Uruguay's president in 2010, He shuns official palaces in favour of living on his farm and still owns his 1987 blue VW Beetle, which he uses to get to official events. The BBC's Ignacio de los Reyes travelled to Montevideo to meet him. Jadav Payeng was born on the world's largest river island - Majuli Island in the Brahmaputra River in northeast India. As a teenager in the 1970s he witnessed the effect that climate change was having on the island and to combat erosion he created a forest which now covers 1,300 acres.
