Linor Abargil from Israel was just 18 years old when she was crowned Miss World at a huge glitzy ceremony in 1998 in the Seychelles.

In 2008 Soyeon Yi became South Korea's first and only astronaut. She blasted off on a Soyuz spacecraft in a joint venture with the Russian space agency. She spent 10 days running experiments on the International Space Station, and even survived a crash landing. Steven Spielberg is one of the world's most successful film directors. He drew on memories of his parents' divorce while making Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and his childhood also informs his new film, Bridge Of Spies, which has just been nominated for an Oscar. Wai Wai Nu is a political campaigner from Myanmar. She is a member of the minority Rohingya community, and her father was also a political campaigner against the military regime in the country. His activities led to Wai Wai Nu and the rest of her family being arrested when she was just 18, and she spent most of her adult life in prison. (Photo: Linor Abargil. Credit: Yaniv Edri) Show less
