When Nokwazi Memela's pastor told her about a job importing carpets from Iran she was excited about earning money to support her children. Little did she know she had been tricked into becoming a drug mule. In the week of International Women's Day we celebrate some of the many incredible women who've shared their stories with Outlook. And we hear from the hugely successful British bookseller, Tim Waterstone, whose own love affair with books helped him escape a difficult childhood.
