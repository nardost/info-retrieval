Philip Dodd chairs a debate from Free Thinking 2011 on the obsession with change. Panel includes BAFTA award-winning film-maker Molly Dineen and the Rev Dr Giles Fraser, former Canon Chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral. Continuing BBC Radio 3's three weeks of broadcasts from the 2011 Free Thinking festival of ideas, Philip Dodd and guests discuss the central theme of this year's festival: Change. Politics, work, fashion, technology, our personal lives - all now seem subject to never-ending change. Is this the sign of a dynamic and flexible society, or is it causing us instability and insecurity? Debaters include the BAFTA award-winning director Molly Dineen, whose documentaries have chronicled change in British society, Rev Dr Giles Fraser, former Canon Chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral who recently resigned over the Occupy London protest, the futurologist and predictor of change James Woudhuysen, Professor of Innovation and Forecasting at Leicester's De Montfort University, and Dr Liz Mellon, author and leadership expert, Executive Director with Duke Corporate Education, part of Duke University. The event is chaired by Night Waves' Philip Dodd and is recorded as part of BBC Radio 3's 2011 Free Thinking festival of ideas, taking place at The Sage Gateshead 4 - 6 November.
