As a production of Oh What a Lovely War opens at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, Matthew Sweet discusses the way World War I is being commemorated. He revisits Alan Bleasdale's 1986 TV series The Monocled Mutineer starring Paul McGann. The subject of heated debates at the time of its broadcast, McGann has continued to study what is known about the soldier Percy Toplis, who inspired the series. Philosopher Roman Krznaric wants to launch an empathy revolution. He explains what he wants to put in his museum of empathy and why it can change lives and inspire political action. His book Empathy, A Handbook for Revolution is published this week. Producer: Neil Trevithick. Show less
