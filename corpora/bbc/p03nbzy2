In 1916 the United Kingdom came under attack from within. Irish nationalist rebels, allied with Germany, seized control of Dublin to proclaim an Irish Republic. Their first victim was an Irishman. Their action - violent, daring, impossibly romantic - would change the majority of Irish public opinion radically towards demands for full independence and push Northern Ireland's Unionists further towards partition. This was Britain's war within the war. One hundred years on, historian Heather Jones reassesses the armed struggle that came to be known as The Easter Rising.
