When Mats Steen was a young child growing up in Oslo, he was diagnosed with a degenerative disease. His parents Robert and Trude were told it was unlikely Mats would survive long into his 20s, and that he'd become less mobile as time went on. The physical restraints of his illness meant that Mats spent more and more time at home, playing online games. He died when he was 25, and his parents worried that his life had been lonely and friendless. Then, in the days before the funeral a mysterious group of people started arriving in Oslo. Robert and Trude didn't know them, but they seemed to know Mats extremely well. Outlooks discovers who they were. A version of this story by Vicky Schaubert was first published in Norwegian by broadcaster NRK.
