Adrian Street grew up in a mining town in South Wales, but he always loved dressing up. When he was a teenager he started working down the mines, but his dream was to become a wrestler. He was ridiculed by the other miners he worked with, but in the 1950s he moved to London to pursue his dream and "The Exotic Adrian Street" was born. His wrestling persona was a haughty androgynous character who would strut about the stage pouting and blowing kisses to the crowds when they abused him for his flamboyant style.
