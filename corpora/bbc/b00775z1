THE CULTURAL CONTEXT OF YOUTH SUICIDE Laurie Taylor hears about new research into the suicide risk among young gay, lesbian and transexual people. What are the factors that provoke self harm, and to what extent does self harm indicate a danger of suicide. Katrina Roen, Lecturer in Research Methods at Lancaster University and Professor Stephen Platt, Director, Research Unit in Health, Behaviour and Change, University of Edinburgh discuss the findings. MEMORY IN A RUSSIAN VILLAGE Margaret Paxson, author of Solovyovo, talks about her sixteen years of anthropological field work study of a small lake side village in north Russia. Solovyovo is about 300 miles north of Moscow, the village had about 30 buildings when Margaret lived there, and in the winter months the population was about 40 and mostly in their 50s and older. Margaret witnessed and took part in growing season and its activities where only a limited number of months must provide for food for the entire year. She saw deaths, suicide and violence; people leaving for the cities, and other joining the village. She discovered how the social idea of svoi - fellow feeling - amongst the villagers had allowed them to survive the ravages of totalitarian history. FOOTBALL IN THE PUB: Professor Mike Weed talks about his new research into why so many people now watch football in the pub, and how they find it as enjoyable as going to the match. Show less
