Marcellus Baz grew up in Nottingham in central England. He was a promising boxer when he was attacked on the street. His hands were cut to pieces and it looked like his career was over, but Marcellus did something remarkable to pick himself up. Sergeant David Mascarenas is part of the Los Angeles police underwater dive unit. He's responsible for collecting bodies, weapons, and other evidence from the waterways of the city. But a recent murder enquiry brought him a new challenge: diving into one of the city's tar pits. (Featuring news footage from NBC, CBS, KTLA and ABC News) Image: Crime scene tape.
