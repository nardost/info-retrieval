As Mexico takes centre stage at London's Book Fair Matthew Sweet talks to two of the country's award-winning writers. Valeria Luiselli's new novel The Story of My Teeth explores the meaning of home through the antics of an auctioneer, told in his own hyperbolic fashion, who has decided views on the meaning of value and worth in life and art. Francisco Goldman's The Interior Circuit takes us on a journey through grieving after the loss of Aura Estrada, his wife, in 2007, and his current fears for Mexico City, the place they made their own. Playwright Simon Stephens talks to Matthew about transplanting Carmen into a modern urban idiom and whether Carmen Disruption in London will be different to Carmen Disruption in Hamburg. His starting point as ever will be what disturbs and dares an audience to think and feel. And Christopher Doyle: No Glass Twice as Big as It Needs to Be - the cinematographer and film director has his first solo art show in Europe opening at London Gallery Rossi & Rossi. He talks to Matthew Sweet about the give and take relationship he enjoys with his Chinese alter-ego Du Ke Feng and how creating collage helps his film-making.
