Father "Rocky" Evangelista has been running the Tuloy sa Don Bosco School in the Philippines for over 20 years. It looks like a well-resourced school for the privileged, with large, well-tended gardens and modern buildings - but the school's pupils are all former street children. Hear Father Rocky talk about how he has made it his mission to rescue Manila's street kids from a life of violence and crime. We hear from Shailee Basnet - the leader of an all-female Nepalese climbing team who have become the first women team to conquer the highest mountains on all the seven continents. The American long-distance runner with Multiple Sclerosis, Kayla Montgomery, describes how she canot feel her legs when she picks up speed. She is joined by her high school running coach Patrick Cromwell who has to catch her at the end of every race. And Russian ballet star Mikhail Baryshnikov talks about why he has taken up photography.
