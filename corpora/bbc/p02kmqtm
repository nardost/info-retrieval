Maryse Wolinski is the wife of Georges Wolinski, one of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists murdered in Paris in January. Georges was 80 years old and one of France's most beloved cartoonists. When she was in her 20s, Istarlin fled to Europe to escape the civil war in Somalia, and ended up living in the UK. Once a week, she would get together and cook with a group of other refugees and migrant women. They were so successful, they started a catering company called the Chickpea Sisters. Cuong Vu has done something highly unusual for a single man in Vietnam - he has adopted a child. Cuong had always wanted children, but relationships had not worked out. So four years ago, he headed down the adoption route, a decision that brought him into conflict with traditional notions of the family. The Best Actress award at this year's Oscars went to Julianne Moore, for her role in the film, Still Alice. She plays Alice Howland, a linguistics professor and mother of three grown-up children, who - at the age of 50 - is diagnosed with Alzheimer's, a condition that attacks memory.
