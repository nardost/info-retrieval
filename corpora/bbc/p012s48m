Fredy Peccerelli, the director of the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Foundation, has exhumed many thousands of bodies over the last 18 years. Fredy played a key role in documenting thousands of extra-judicial killings that took place during the bloody years of Guatemala's civil war. In the heady days of the early 70s, a group of more than 300 hippies drove from San Francisco across the US to eventually settle in Tennessee. The hippies bought a thousand acres of land and founded 'The Farm'. It was a self-governing, self-sufficient commune that grew to 1,500 members by 1980, and attracted thousands of curious visitors. Filmmaker sisters Nadine Mundo and Rena Mundo Croshere were born there and produced a film about their their childhood.
