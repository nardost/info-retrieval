JEAN ROBERT CADET Jean Robert Cadet grew up in Haiti as a "restavec" child. Restavec is a creole word which literally means "stay with" but it hides a much more sinister reality, deeply ingrained in Haitian society. It involves children from poor families being handed on to better off families, where they work and are often beaten, starved and dressed only in rags. Jean Robert tells Matthew Bannister why he is determined to protect restavec children currently living in Haiti. He has written a book about his life entitled "Restavec: from Haitian slave child to middle class American". GABRIEL NDERITU For the last year Kenyan IT engineer Gabriel Nderitu has had a strange hobby. The aviation enthusiast wasn't content with a model aeroplane. Instead he's been lovingly hand building a full sized, two seater, collapsible plane in his front yard in Nairobi. Michael Kaloki went along to meet him and see how his creation is coming along.
