Laurence Scott, one of BBC Radio 3's New Generation Thinkers, gives a talk on the fascinating figure of the gothic heroine, recorded at the BBC Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival. Swooning maidens crowd early horror stories, but these hunted heroines are also stalked through the pages of 20th Century novels such as Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway and Iris Murdoch's The Unicorn. Laurence Scott explores the evolution of the gothic heroine. This essay is recorded in front of an audience at the BBC Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival 2011, which takes place at The Sage Gateshead 4 - 6 November. The New Generation Thinkers are winners of the inaugural talent scheme run by BBC Radio 3 and the Arts and Humanities Research Council to find the brightest academic minds in the arts and humanties with the potential to turn their ideas into fascinating broadcasts.
