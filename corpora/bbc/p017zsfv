How can we embrace the views of many and still take decisive action? Joining Bridget Kendall are Harvard Professor Joseph Nye, who asks how much individual decisions by American presidents mattered over the course of the last century; veteran of the Occupy Wall Street movement, social anthropologist David Graeber who talks about an alternative way of decision making, a consensus model; dialogue facilitator Martijn de Liefde who has adapted traditional African techniques to guide decisions in todayâ€™s large companies; and Oxford professor Stephen Whitefield who explains why politicians are increasingly appealing to our emotions.
