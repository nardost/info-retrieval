Sin√©ad Morrissey is the winner of this year's T S Eliot Prize for her anthology Parallax. She performs her poems and talks to Anne McElvoy about her role as Belfast's first Poet Laureate. As a new wall is built between Bulgaria and Turkey to deter immigrants Anne explores the way governments use walls to control people's movements and the political and architectural impact of walls as both barriers and gateways. With Michael Dumper, Professor of Middle Eastern Politics at the University of Exeter, Dr Wendy Pullan, Senior Lecturer in the History and Philosophy of Architecture at the University of Cambridge, Dr Lea Ypi, political scientist at the London School of Economics, and Dr Alan Mendoza, Director of the Henry Jackson Society Radio 3 is currently devoting its Sunday night Drama on 3 to new versions of Aeschylus's classic trilogy about murder, revenge and justice, The Oresteia. Playwright Rebecca Lenkiewicz, who has adapted Part Three, The Furies, and classicist Edith Hall discuss the tragedies and their modern relevance. Show less
