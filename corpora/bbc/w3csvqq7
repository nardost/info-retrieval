Teresa Njoroge from Kenya had always dreamed of following in her father's footsteps and becoming a banker. But in 2009 her dream came crashing down. The police arrived at the bank she worked at to investigate a fraudulent transaction and arrested her. She was left with a terrible choice, leave her child or take her to prison. The American musician Jerron Paxton is on a mission. Although he's only 28 years old, he's determined to bring back to life the blues music that was popular in the States in the 1920s. He's partially sighted and nicknamed 'Blind Boy' Paxton. Fernando Trujillo is a marine biologist who's dedicated his life to the conservation of dolphins, but you'll rarely find him out at sea. Instead, his passion has taken him deep into the rainforest, home to the rare pink river dolphins that live in the Amazon. Not everyone appreciates his conservation work, and his clashes with the local fishing industry left him in mortal danger. In many Indian cities you'll see auto rickshaws zooming around the streets.
