It’s a style of dress that’s spread around the world - the suit. It’s survived, largely unchanged, for the three centuries.

Mike Williams talks to fashion designer Paul Smith who wears one every day and to the author Jung Chang who had no choice but to follow suit during the Cultural Revolution in China.
