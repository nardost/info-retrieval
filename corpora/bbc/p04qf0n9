When Cameroonian Yvan Sagnet got a job picking tomatoes in southern Italy he discovered that gangmasters, called Caporali, were subjecting migrants to cruel conditions. He decided to expose them and has now been awarded with the highest-ranking honour in Italy. Isaac Kehimkar from India is also known as the 'Butterfly Man'. This is because he's spent forty years chasing butterflies and he reckons there's nothing more beautiful in nature... Outlook's Divya Arya went to meet him. Sergeant David Mascarenas is part of the police underwater dive unit in the American city of Los Angeles. He's responsible for collecting weapons, bodies and other evidence from the waterways of the city. But when a murder enquiry began, he faced a new challenge: diving into one of the city's tar pits.
