Hannah Milbrandt grew up in a small town in Ohio. Hannah led a normal life until she was six years old, when she got a cough, and her mum thought she should see a doctor. This led to a terrifying diagnosis, but, as she explains, things were not what they seemed. There's a nail bar in the Bronx, New York City, where it's all about the bling. It's run by a talented nail technician called Jenny Bui, and it's where the rapper Cardi B comes to get her signature stiletto finger nails done. Jenny was born in Cambodia to Chinese parents, and has been on a challenging journey to get to where she is now. Our reporter Tara Gadomski went to the nail bar to meet her.
