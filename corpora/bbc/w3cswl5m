In the summer of 1980 Sohaila Abdulali was out walking in the hills in Mumbai with a friend when she was attacked and raped by a group of four men. Sohaila was just 17 at the time, but she refused to be ashamed by what had happened to her. She wrote a powerful article for an Indian women's magazine describing her experience. Sohaila moved to America and became a successful author. Many years later those words she wrote would go on to have a profound effect and inspire many others to share their stories. The Egyptian famous puppeteer Mohamed Bakkar builds beautiful marionette dolls. He tells Outlook's Nirvana El Saied each one he makes are like his babies. And the Australian mum Sandy Laverty whose fishing trip with her family ended in a horrendous boat accident. She and her family were setting up crab pots on the Cato River in Australiaâ€™s Northern Territory in June last year when her boat spun out of control in the crocodile invested waters.
