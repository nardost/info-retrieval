Matthew Bannister on Frederick Sanger, the only Briton - and one of only four people in the world - to win the Nobel Prize twice. His work underpinned the Human Genome Project. Also another Nobel prize winner - the prolific novellist Doris Lessing. We have tributes from Brian Aldiss and Faye Weldon. The broadcaster and gay rights campaigner Ray Gosling who made quirky and distinctive programmes for BBC Radio. Jock Kane, who blew the whistle on security breaches at GCHQ. And the record producer Austin John Marshall, best known for his work with his wife, the folk singer Shirley Collins. She pays tribute. Producer: Neil George. Show less
