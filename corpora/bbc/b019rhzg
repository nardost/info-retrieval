Andrew Marr explores the idea of Justice on Start the Week. In a satire on the International Criminal Tribunal, the playwright Simon Stephens, asks how far such a court can deal with perpetrators of terrible crimes, when the accused neither recognises its authority, or shares its morality. Closer to home John Podmore looks back at 25 years as a prison governor and inspector, in a damning indictment on Britain's prison service. The criminologist Mike Hough asks why people obey the law, and questions whether the threat of punishment is ever a deterrent. And the director of Liberty Shami Chakrabarti defends the right to civil liberties and freedom of speech, even of those many may consider to be unpalatable. Producer: Natalia Fernandez. Show less
