The plane was miles from land, the passenger's medication was locked in the hold and Dr Guru had to think on his feet to help the save the child. Just about everyone in the Indonesian city of Garut depends on goats - from the farmers who breed them, to the tanners who turn their skins into the soft leather that the city is famous for... to the restaurants that turn them into curry... But making a living from goats isn't easy. Outlook reporter Candida Beveridge has been finding out. Award-winning Canadian novelist Miriam Toews lost her sister to suicide five years ago. She's just published a novel based on their relationship - a surprisingly funny book called All My Puny Sorrows. It's her sixth novel and tells the story of two sisters, Yoli, and her older sister, Elf, a famous pianist who's desperate to die. Miriam told me just how close the book comes to her own life. Steve Angello grew up in two different worlds. In Stockholm with his Swedish mother, and in Athens with his father, who was heavily involved in the criminal underworld. As a teenager, it looked as though Steve would follow in his father's footsteps - but he ended up a world famous DJ with the electronic dance trio, Swedish House Mafia. How did it happen? Our reporter Jack Stewart caught up with Steve in Hollywood. (Picture: Dr Khurshid Guru. Credit: Dr Khurshid Guru.) Show less
