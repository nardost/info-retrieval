Anthony Brennan was spending a few days at his uncle's house in Australia when two cars crashed outside the house. He immediately ran to the scene to help and found one of the victims lying unconscious in his car. Anthony held the stranger's skull together until the ambulance arrived. Not only did he help save the stranger's life, it also helped him to get his own life back on track. Adrian Mann from New Zealand built, arguably, the longest piano in the world when he was still a teenager. And he has even started work on a project to build an even bigger one. Costume designer Ruth Carter has been working in theatre, film and TV for more than 25 years.
