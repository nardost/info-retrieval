Jang Yeong-jin defected from North Korea to South Korea in 1997. His reason was highly unusual - he wanted to escape his marriage, though at the time he did not understand why. It was only when he got to the South that he was introduced to the concept of homosexuality and realised he was gay. His autobiography is called A Mark of Red Honour. During his youth in the 1940s, Englishman Grenville Cole was a keen swimmer who swam for England. After a 68-year break, he has just embarked on a second competitive swimming career at the age of 85. He tells our reporter Emily Webb why. Jayro Bustamante's debut feature film Ixcanul has been creating quite a stir in his native Guatemala. It tells the story of an indigenous Mayan teenager and very unusually, the actors are Mayan and it is in one of the Mayan languages. Show less
