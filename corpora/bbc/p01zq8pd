Bobby Friction traces how young people in India are expressing themselves through music and the massive rise in independent music and festivals. Recorded on location at NH7 in Bangalore, India’s Glastonbury. Indian culture is changing rapidly and with the rise of a young middle class population who are having a new voice, disposable income and want a say in their futures, changes in music culture are reflecting this. They are moving away from their parents’ perspective - a culture where Bollywood music dominates. They are moving away too from Western dominated music to create something fresh. India has seen a massive rise in home grown rock, indie, electronica and even reggae, fusing Indian music with Western influences. We ask if these changes have caused tensions between the generations. British DJ Bobby Friction, who regularly plays at India’s clubs and at festivals speaks to musicians, music producers, festival goers and organisers, to find out how the youth movement is reflecting cultural changes in India. With the narrative of Bangalore’s NH7 Festival as the back-drop, Bobby sees a buoyant and confident new sector of India’s youth who are expressing themselves as independent global citizens. Interviews include NH7 founders Vijay Nair and Stephen Budd (the man behind Africa Express) who wanted to alter the idea of only having the likes of Sting and Simply Red visiting India. We also speak to Indian superstar Kailash Kher, Indian electronica band Shaa’ir and Func and music producer Miti Adhikari. Picture: Bobby Friction at NH7 Show less
