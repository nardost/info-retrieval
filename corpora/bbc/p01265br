The sons and daughters of Afghanistan's war leaders, the Mujahideen, have created an informal network to discuss the future of their country and work towards peace. We hear from Yaqoob Emad, who started the network, as well as Fatima Rabbani, Batur Dostum and Abid Khan. Matthew is joined in the studio by Tahir Qadiry of BBC Persian TV, who puts this initiative in context. Picture: Yaqoob Emad Show less
