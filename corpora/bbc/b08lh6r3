This week's great life has been rather neglected by many; making the case that she deserves better is Germaine Greer. Dame Elizabeth Frink was best known for striking sculptures ranging from horses and goats to wild eagles and disembodied heads. As a female sculptor working in a man's world, Elisabeth Frink found it hard to establish herself in the 1950s. To help tell the story of her hero, Germaine Greer is joined by Frink's son Lin Jammet and art critic Richard Cork. The presenter is Matthew Parris and the producer is Perminder Khatkar. Show less
