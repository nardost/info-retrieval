British artist Marcus Robinson tells Matthew about his latest work 'Rebuilding' which focuses on the construction of the new World Trade Center in New York. Knitting behind bars in Brazil - we meet Raquell Guimaraes, the fashion designer who has been teaching prisoners how to knit and crochet. Plus, the story of the Chinese man who was abducted and sold at the age of five - and who managed to track down his birth family through the internet 23 years later. And we meet Alessandro Bordini, the Italian man who lost his sight in an accident and is now travelling around the world relying on the kindness of strangers.
