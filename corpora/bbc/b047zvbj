'Oh what a lovely Savas' begins Rana Mitter in this edition of Free Thinking, using the Turkish word for War. Along with Sean McMeekin of the Koc University in Istanbul, the novelist Kamila Shamsie, Naoko Shimazu of Birkbeck College and Erez Manela of Harvard University Rana puts Japan, China, India, the Ottomans, Koreans and others centre stage in the years 1914 to 1918. If you weren't from one of the European Great Powers could you even get into the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 which was to lead to the Treaty of Versailles? And was the failure of the Racial Equality Clause to get on the statute books at this conference the beginning of the end of Empire even for those who won the war ? Rana and guests discuss a world in which creating an empire was the accepted way of gaining a place at the top table of international diplomacy and power... until a war changed the way the world was for everyone - including the victors. The very legitimacy of the idea of Empire was possibly the biggest ideological casualty of the so called First World War. That's 'Oh What a Lovely Savas' with Rana Mitter and guests - Free Thinking.
