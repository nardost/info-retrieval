Robert Katende was brought up in a slum in Uganda but his life was transformed when he discovered the game of chess. He has gone on to teach the game to some of Kampala's poorest children including Phiona Mutesi who has represented Uganda at the world chess championships and whose story has been made into a Disney film called "The Queen of Katwe". Maria Toor Pakay is so passionate about sport that she once disguised herself as a boy to enter a weightlifting competition. She comes from an ultra-conservative region of Pakistan, where many strongly believe that women should not take part in any kind of sport. Despite having received death threats from those who disagreed with her competing, Maria has now become a world class squash player.
