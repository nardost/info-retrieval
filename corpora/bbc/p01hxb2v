State prosecutor Kym Worthy has embarked on a mission to investigate 11,000 rape kits that were found in an unused warehouse in Detroit. She is determined to bring the perpetuators to justice. Since she started, Prosecutor Worthy and her team have identified 50 serial rapists - and 10 men have been convicted. And the project is continuing. Also, Gideon Long tells us that in Chile there has been an outpouring of books, films and art about former Socialist president Salvador Allende. We hear from the young Ugandan woman who started adopting street children when she was just 14 years old. And, from Rzgar Mustafa Mohammad, a mayor in Northern Iraq, who has suddenly found himself in charge of a refugee camp. (Picture: Prosecutor Kym Worthy.
