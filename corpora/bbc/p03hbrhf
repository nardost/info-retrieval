Last Broadcast Date: Sun 14 Feb 2016
Cassandro is no ordinary Mexican wrestler. He is an exotico - or drag queen - who wears long Liberace gowns, sequins and flamboyant make-up. Over an extraordinary 27-year-career, Cassandro has won two championship belts and pioneered the idea that a Mexican wrestler can be openly gay. At home, in the training ring, and backstage before his big fight, Cassandro takes us into a spectacular world of lucha libre and shines a fascinating light on Mexican culture and ideas about masculinity.
