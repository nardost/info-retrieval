The prehistoric migration of humans, the first explorers on Earth. In the first of a three part series we look at how early humans, with just their own two feet and the spirit of adventure travelled to new lands. The programme travels to Australia, a continent where some of the earliest civilisations appear to have arrived by sea from Africa over 60,000 years ago. Show less
