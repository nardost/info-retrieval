Kalpona Akter travels the world trying to get consumers to think about where their clothes come from. As a child she worked in a textile factory in Bangladesh, and was so shocked by the conditions that she's put her life on the line to change things. Kirsten Alvey-Mudd is obsessed with bats. So much so that she's dedicated her entire life to protecting them. They need the help - these animals face many dangers including 'white nose syndrome' where the bats are forced to wake up from hibernation, and end up starving to death. And we meet Luc Bendza from Gabon who became so obsessed with Bruce Lee films - that he made it his mission to travel to China and learn how to fly, just like his Kung Fu heroes.
