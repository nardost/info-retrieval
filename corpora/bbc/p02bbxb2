There are now more pirate attacks in the Gulf of Guinea than off the coast of Somalia - once considered the global 'piracy hotspot'. The BBCâ€™s Mary Harper travels to Lagos, one of the busiest ports in Africa, to explore what is a highly complex world of piracy. She tells for the first time the story of seafarers who have been caught up in violent and highly-organised attacks, speaks to former militants who themselves committed acts of piracy and who are now controversially being employed, at a high cost, to tackle piracy and examines the economic cost to communities who depend on maritime trade.
