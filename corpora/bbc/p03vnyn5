For thousands of years, a thin body was a sign of poverty or disease. But there is now a growing, global obsession with being thin.

Mike Williams finds out why, as he speaks to former French model Victoire Macon Dauxerre, Tony Glenville from the London College of Fashion, Anne Becker from Harvard Medical School, Professor John Speakman from University of Aberdeen and Etta Edim from Nigeriaâ€™s Efik tribe.
