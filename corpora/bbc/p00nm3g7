Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, Matthew Bannister talks to Baraa Melhem, a young Palestinian woman who was locked up in tiny rooms for nine years by her father. She describes how she kept in touch with the outside world by listening to the BBC Arabic Service. And we meet Jenny Sealey, a deaf theatre director who's taking on her biggest challenge - co-directing the opening ceremony of the London Paralympic Games. (Iamge: Baraa Melhem.
