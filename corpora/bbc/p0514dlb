Over the last two years, thousands of people have been killed in the conflict in Yemen. Some expectant mothers caught up in the fighting have lost their children - while others have given birth in terrifying circumstances. One of them is Dr Mariam Aldogani who works for the charity Save the Children, helping pregnant women in the areas around the capital Sana'a. She tells Matthew Bannister about her own experience of giving birth during an air raid in 2015. Compton, a city south of Los Angeles in the USA, is probably best known for the rap and hip hop music made there, but beyond the inner-city streets there's something you wouldn't expect - stables full of horses. For Outlook, Laura Hubber went to meet the owner of the stables Mayisha Akbar - she tells Laura how she's using horses to keep kids out of street gangs. Maxmillan Martin was born in the Indian state of Kerala and now works as a researcher at the University of Sussex in England, but he's come up with an idea for a rather unusual radio station. It's based in Kerala - and its called Radio Monsoon. The station broadcasts weather forecasts during monsoon season to help local fishermen navigate the storms. Maxmillan was inspired to start the radio station after the tsunami that hit the country in 2004. In 1997, British born Emma Slade was a high-flying financial analyst working for a large investment bank in Hong Kong, but when she was on a business trip to Jakarta, she suffered an attack that would change her life forever. She tells Matthew Bannister why she ended up becoming a Buddhist nun. She's written a book about her life called Set Free: A Life-Changing Journey From Banking to Buddhism in Bhutan.
