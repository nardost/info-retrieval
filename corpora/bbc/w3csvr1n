Australian film-maker Joel de Carteret began his life just outside Manila in the Philippines. In 1985, when he was just four, he wandered away from his family home and got lost. Would he ever find his biological mum again in this city of millions? Sanford "Sandy" Greenberg lost his sight at 19. Sandy's friend, guide, and college roommate was Art Garfunkel, who went on to become a world-famous singer as part of Simon and Garfunkel. But once, Art 'abandoned' Sandy at Grand Central Terminal in New York during rush hour. Sandy reckons that moment changed his life forever. Photo credit: Getty images Show less
