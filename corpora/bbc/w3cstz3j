Harold Fernandez grew up in Colombia during the violent years of the drug cartels. In 1978 his parents brought him to the US illegally. He managed to get into a top university and became a cardiac surgeon. Ronald Grant started The Cinema Museum in London with a friend in 1986. It's based in London, in the former warehouse where actor Charlie Chaplin used to live and it documents the history of cinema-going. In Peru, at least 300,000 people, most of them women, are estimated to have been sterilised during a controversial family planning programme that took place in the 1990s. Many of these women say they were given no choice in the decision, Esperanza Huayama says she is one of them. She is now the Vice President of the Association of Forcibly Sterilised Women in Peru, an organisation that raises awareness about this. Eduardo Martins claimed to be a war photographer and his pictures appeared in reputable international outlets. The only problem is that Eduardo Martins does not actually exist. The photographs were stolen from an actual war photographer and the face used was that of British surfer Max Hepworth-Povey. We spoke to Max about what it felt like to be caught in this media storm.
