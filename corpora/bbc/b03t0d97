Tonight on Free Thinking, Philip Dodd is in extended conversation with the novelist, screenwriter and dramatist Hanif Kureishi. Since his early success in the 1980s with My Beautiful Laundrette and The Buddha of Suburbia, Kureishi has been the author of many novels and a series of films with the director Roger Michell. His latest novel, The Last Word, the story of an ageing Indian writer and his young biographer, returns to themes which have interested Kureishi since the start of his career - race, sex and desire, class and humour. He discusses with Philip why immigrants are seen as an eternal spectre Britain, changing views of sexuality and the shadow of mortality.
