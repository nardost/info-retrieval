Dr Evan Atar Adaha is the chief surgeon at a hospital in a conflict-ridden area of South Sudan. The hospital, where Dr Atar performs many surgeries a day, caters to hundreds of thousands of refugees and internally displaced people. He set up Maban hospital in 2011, after fleeing from the government bombing in neighbouring Blue Nile State of Sudan, where he'd been working at another medical facility. Dr Atar and his team packed up whatever medicine and medical equipment they could salvage, and after a month long journey during the rainy season, they began to re-build a derelict hospital. He recently won the UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award. Travel writer Claire Nelson was hiking in Joshua Tree, California when she slipped off a boulder and fell 15 feet into a canyon. She was trapped, and completely alone in the scorching hot wilderness, with limited water. How would she survive?
