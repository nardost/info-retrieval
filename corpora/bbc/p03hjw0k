Maung Nyeu's learning journey took him from one side of the world to the other - and then back again. He says he owes his life to education. Maung was born in a remote mountainous area in the south-eastern corner of Bangladesh called the Chittagong Hill Tracts. It is home to indigenous groups which have their own languages and customs. He grew up speaking the Marma language rather than the official language of Bangladesh, Bangla. Maung told Outlook that when the time came for him to attend school he found himself in a difficult position. A Chilean artist has created what is thought to be the largest mural made of bottle tops in Latin America. Elvira Valenzuela Murillo made the work in her local town of Quintero to create awareness of recycling. Our reporter Jane Chambers went to meet Elvira and the volunteers working on her latest project. Steven Spielberg's ET: The Extra Terrestrial is recognised by critics and film fans as one of the greatest movies of all time but the video game based on the film has been called the worst video game of all time. So bad, that in the early 1980s it was blamed for causing the collapse of a billion dollar company. This incident has defined the life of one man in particular. The designer of the game was Howard Scott Warshaw. Howard told Outlook that it was at the age of 23 that he landed his dream job at the tech company Atari. (Photo: Maung Nyeu.
