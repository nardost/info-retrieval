In the last five decades the capital of Afghanistan - Kabul - has witnessed at least seven regime changes and the people there have endured harsh periods of civil war. In that time neighbourhoods have been destroyed and thousands of lives have changed beyond recognition. But what has that meant for the people who live there? Meena Baktash, born and bred in Kabul, tells the story of the city she grew up in. Her life became a rollercoaster ride of shifting rules and violence, but the environment she lived in was place of beauty with a vibrant culture and populated with inspiring people. Against a backdrop of a city that is erupting into violence, Meena tells the age-old and intimate story of a family growing up and evolving, celebrating birthdays and weddings. Show less
