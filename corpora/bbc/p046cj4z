One of Australia's first Aboriginal members of parliament, Linda Burney, was brought up in a white family and only reunited with her Aboriginal father when she was 27. She found out that she had 10 brothers and sisters that she had never met, even though they had grown up just 10 minutes apart. Linda became more and more involved in political campaigning. She tells Outlook how she overcame racism to represent her people. Twenty-eight-year-old poet Raya Wambui from Kenya is one of the Slam Queens of Africa. Poetry is a big deal in her home country and Raya gained her title after winning Nairobi's longest-running competition for performance poets. She was just five years old when she got interested in poetry, but had to overcome stage-fright before before she could become a Slam Queen. Albert Jose Jones has been a scuba diver for 65 years. He is the founder of the US National Association of Black Scuba Divers and has now set up a project to locate and map the sunken ships which brought slaves from Africa to the Americas in the 18th and 19th Centuries. Albert has taken part in over 6,000 dives and has trained more than 2,000 other divers. His interest in water began as a child, when he had a huge collection of aquariums. In India it is rare for a Hindu woman to go to a crematorium for the final rituals of her loved ones.
