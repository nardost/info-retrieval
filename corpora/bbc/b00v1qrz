Professor Laurie Taylor looks at new research dealing with the McCarthy period in US History when actors and artists found themselves unable to work having been denounced or charged for having associations with communism. The stigma and the effect of the accusations is examined by Elizabeth Pontikes, author of 'Stained Red' and she discusses her detailed analysis of the work prospects of those associated with black listed actors and film workers in the US film Industry from 1945 to 1960. Laurie also talks to Professor Adam Hedgecoe about his sociological research into a drug trial that went disastrously wrong. Producer: Chris Wilson. Show less
