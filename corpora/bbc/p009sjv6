David Hamilton - From Gunman To Man of God: David Hamilton was born in a Protestant family in a poor part of Belfast during Northern Ireland's Troubles. As a teenager, he joined a Belfast street gang - burning cars and attacking the local Catholic community. In his 20s he became an active member of the loyalist paramilitary groups the Ulster Defence Association and then the even more hardline Ulster Volunteer Force. David orchestrated bombings and robberies, and brought terror to the streets of Northern Ireland. He was eventually sentenced to 11 years in the notorious H blocks in the Maze prison. It was when he was in jail that David picked up a Bible in his cell and experienced what he calls a "divine intervention." He committed himself to religion, reached out to Catholic prisoners, and eventually, after he was released, became an ordained minister in England. He has been telling Matthew Bannister about his remarkable journey from gunman to man of God. Show less
