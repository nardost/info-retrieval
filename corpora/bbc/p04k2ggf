Arn Chorn Pond survived a Khmer Rouge labour camp by playing traditional musical instruments for those in charge. He later became a child soldier and after months living alone in the jungle he was eventually able to make a new life for himself in America. Donu Kogbara is a journalist from Port Harcourt in the Niger Delta. There is a high level of poverty, a lot of weapons and a choice of militant groups who complain that local people aren't getting a fair share of the oil money. Donu was inclined to agree but in August last year, she became part of the story herself when she had a late-night visit from supporters of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta.
