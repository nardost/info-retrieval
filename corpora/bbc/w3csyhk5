Outlook’s Abdulmalik Fahd drops in on Spoof Animations, one of Nigeria’s newest cartoon studios, where a new generation of Nigerians are drawing new kinds of superheroes. We talk to Ayodele Elegba who founded the studio and decided to recruit Emmanuel Oluwasegun and Tunrayo Oloyede, young animators who bring to life characters that reflect their own experience and tell the stories of their fellow Nigerians. Akintunde Akinleye is an award-winning photographer who’s spent much of his career photographing real life heroes – the firefighters battling pipeline explosions around the gridlocked city. One photograph of the aftermath of an explosion changed his life when he won an international photography award. Photo: Jinx the superhero Credit: Spoof Animations Show less
