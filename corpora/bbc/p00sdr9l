As Britain celebrates The Diamond Jubilee - 60 years of Queen Elizabeth II's rule - the Forum takes a look at the role of tradition in the 21st Century. How important is it? Not just in linking us to our collective past but in helping to forge the future, especially in the countries now in the midst of the Arab Spring? And what happens in an ancient culture whose language has no way of describing the past? How does art challenge complacency by subverting tradition? Bridget Kendall's guests are the award winning British artist Grayson Perry, anthropologist and expert on Amazonian languages Dan Everett, and the Islamic philosopher Tariq Ramadan.
