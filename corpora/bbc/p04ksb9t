US Army interpreter Nayyef Hrebid and Iraqi soldier Btoo Allami met and fell in love during the height of the Iraq War. But how did their love survive in a country where same-sex relationships are taboo, and gay people are often at risk of violent attacks? In the small town of Puerto Berrio in Colombia some say the souls of the dead reside amongst the living. Locals take the traditional 'El Mes de las Animas', or the Month of the Souls, very seriously - not just praying for the dead, but also 'adopting' and caring for unidentified corpses - mostly people who've been killed in the civil conflict. Natalio Cosoy went to see what it's all about. Kombo Chokwe Burns is a Kenyan musician who's determined to bring the traditional music from the land of the Mijikenda to the mainstream. He continues to play guitar with his band Afro Simba, despite losing the use of his right hand in a car accident. Outlook's Andrea Kidd visited his studio in Nairobi.
