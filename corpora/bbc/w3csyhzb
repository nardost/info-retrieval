Teodora VÃ¡squez is from El Salvador and in 2007 was pregnant and planning her future. However, when she had a stillborn baby Teodora was arrested and eventually sentenced to 30 years in prison for the baby's murder. She then found out she wasn't the only woman this had happened to. Teodora spoke to Emily Webb about her fight for freedom. Education has always been important to Virginia Walden Ford. As a child she was part of the process of desegregating schools in Little Rock in Arkansas, US. Years later, as a parent, she watched as her son's grades dropped and his behaviour deteriorated. She believed his school was failing him and began a long campaign for change in the US education system. Virginia is the subject of a new feature film called Miss Virginia.
