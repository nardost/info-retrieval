The laws on abortion in Ireland were some of the strictest in Europe. Abortion was only allowed if the life of the mother was in danger, and a woman who was convicted of having an illegal abortion could have faced up to fourteen years in prison. This May Ireland voted on this issue for the first time in 34 years. The country voted to remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution which acknowledged and defended the right to life of the unborn. Sarah McInerney speaks to the people who campaigned for the each side - Save the Eighth and Together for Yes - as they clashed on the most contentious issue in Irish society. This programme focuses on the campaigns, voting and result of the referendum with an overview of the history and major turning points in the abortion debate over the past few decades, supported by personal testimonies from people who have experienced abortion and those who are fundamentally against it.
