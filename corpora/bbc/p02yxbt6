Last Broadcast Date: Fri 21 Aug 2015
Growing up Jamila Afghani had to hide the fact that she was going to school from her disapproving brothers, but these days she trains thousands of imams to deliver sermons on the importance of educating women across Afghanistan. She shares her story with Jo Fidgen, and you can watch Jamila in action on our BBC Afghan Service. Dragons appear in fables and mythical stories in different languages around the world. One of the much talked about shows at this year's Edinburgh Festivals is called 'Dragon' and brings together theatre companies from Scotland and China. It tells the story of a teenage boy who's lost his way, and his voice, grieving for his mother's death. Skilful puppetry and powerful imagery are used to tell this story, with no need for words. The BBC's Pooneh Ghoddoosi speaks to Shihui Wang - Associate Producer at National Theatre of Scotland, and Zhang Kai - actor and puppeteer from The Tianjin Children's Art Theatre. Also in Thursday's Outlook we hear from India's strongest man, Manoj Chopra He pulls cars, lies on beds of nails and enjoys ripping apart phone directories. With his big moustache and heavy 6ft 5inch frame, Manoj has earned himself nicknames like the "Chattisgarh Giant" and "Bangalore Bhima" but it hasn't always been this way. The road to being a strong man started in the unlikely setting of a beauty contest. And Outlook speaks to South Africa's owl rescuers, Jonathan Haw and Kefiloe Motaung. They've dedicated themselves to restoring the reputation of the birds. Owls are often attacked in South Africa because of a belief among some they are associated with death, but Jonathan and Kefiloe are challenging those ideas by educating children in schools.
