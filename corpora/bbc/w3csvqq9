Peter Lang runs a safari park in California, home to more than 1,000 wild animals. When the recent wildfires swept towards his hyenas, giraffes and rhinos, the 76-year-old worked all night to put out the raging flames. He tells Matthew Bannister his story. Jamie Campbell is the teenager from County Durham in the UK who wanted to become a professional drag queen called Fifi La True. His story has been turned into a West End musical called Everybody's Talking About Jamie. Pat Furlong is an Ohio mother-of-four who pretended to be a scientist in an attempt to find a cure for her sons, who were diagnosed with the devastating Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy condition. Her efforts led to a change in the US law with extra funding for research into the terminal illness. (Picture: Peter Lang with a rhino in his California safari park. Credit:John Burgess.) Show less
