When Lisette Johnson told her husband their marriage was over, nothing could have prepared her for what followed. He shot her three times before turning the gun on himself. Lisette tells Matthew Bannister about her remarkable survival, and how she is using her terrible experience to help other women who are victims of domestic violence. Also today, we meet Rafea Anad, the Jordanian mother of four, bringing light to her village in the desert. And we launch a search for your favourite lullaby: some new mothers from Somalia who have settled in London tell us about the lullabies they sing to their babies. Show less
