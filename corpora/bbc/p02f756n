Dr Sasa is bringing healthcare to Myanmar's poorest state. He grew up in a village with no running water, no schools, and no medical facilities. Local farmers sold their livestock to put him through medical school and since 2008 Dr Sasa has trained over 800 healthcare workers in Chin state. Jose Armenta lost his legs serving for the US Marines in Afghanistan but wouldn't leave Zenit, his military dog behind. Jose and Zenit's job was to walk ahead of the platoon searching for roadside bombs left by the Taliban. After being blown up in August 2011, Jose was demobilised and returned home. It was then that he launched his mission to be reunited with his canine pal. Nigerian sculptor, Sokari Douglas Camp, cannot go to her home country out of fear for her safety. She now lives in London but comes from the Kalibari town of Buguma in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Many of her sculptures reflect the unstable situation in the region. (Picture: Dr Sasa.
