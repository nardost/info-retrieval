Tetiana Chornovol is a Ukrainian anti-government activist and investigative reporter who has built a reputation for unusual stunts. But her work exposing corruption has come at a price - she says she was brutally attacked last year after her car was forced off the road. The New York trader Turney Duff was paid millions of dollars and lived a lavish life of parties and private jets. But he developed an addiction to cocaine which almost cost him everything. Now he's clean and sober - and has written a book about his experiences. Yuji Mizoguchi is a Japanese computer researcher who has been re-uniting families with thousands of photos swept away by the tsunami. It's an emotional process - because for many these images are the last surviving contact with relatives who died in the disaster.
