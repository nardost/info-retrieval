The human voice is a thing of great power and persuasion; we use it to speak to one another, to sing and cry, to laugh and scream. But our voices - which are as ancient as humanity itself - are also at the forefront of the very latest developments in technology. Increasingly, our voices activate machines, are used to prove innocence or guilt in criminal trials, to provide a means of digital communication for people with voice disorders. With Suzy Klein to discuss the human voice are the cognitive psychologist Diana Deutsch the acoustic, forensic and voice analysis expert Professor Peter French and the opera singer Anna Devin.
