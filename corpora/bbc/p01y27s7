Cécile Kyenge was brought up in the Democratic Republic of Congo, part of a family of 38 children. She travelled to Italy to study medicine, got involved in politics and, in April 2013, became the country's first black cabinet minister. She faced abuse and prejudice from some of her fellow politicians. Cécile has now written a book about her life called Ho Sognato Una Strada, or, in English, I Dreamed of a Path. The best-selling thriller writer David Baldacci tells stories about the American Secret Service and the Washington DC corridors of power. Many of his plots and characters are based on his real life contacts with undercover agents. He tells Matthew Bannister about his latest book, The Target. Dr Mahinder Watsa is a 90-year-old Indian gynaecologist. For over 50 years he has been writing advice columns in magazines and newspapers, and he currently dispenses frank and sometimes very funny advice on sex to his readers. Ruth Buendia talks about the fight to stop her ancestral homelands in Peru being flooded by a huge hydroelectric dam. Her work has has won international acclaim and she has just been awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize. Ziggy Marley is the eldest son of the legendary reggae artist, Bob Marley - and a singer-songwriter in his own right. When Bob Marley died in 1981, Ziggy was just 13 years old. He and his sisters performed at his state funeral. Family and music remain important to Ziggy today.
