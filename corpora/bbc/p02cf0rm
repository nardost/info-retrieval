This week Dr Denis Mukwege from the Democratic Republic of Congo won the European Parliament's top human rights prize. It recognised his tireless work helping thousands of women who had been raped during his country's civil war. Outlook spoke to him last year, just a few months after he had been attacked by gunmen as he returned to his home. A family in Brazil is on a mission to save the Lear's Macaw, a rare parrot that was thought to be extinct in the wild. In 1978, 41 of them were found in the north east of the country by a local farmer, Elizeu Pereira Alves. His sons Dorico and Cabocolo are continuing his work. Writer Clare Allan talks about her acclaimed satire of Britain's mental health treatment system, "Poppy Shakespeare", based on her own experience as a patient. And the young chef, David Geisser, who decided to join the elite Swiss Guard protecting the Pope at the Vatican in Rome. Picture: Dr Denis Mukwege has been awarded the EU's Sakharov Prize Show less
