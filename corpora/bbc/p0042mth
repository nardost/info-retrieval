If he's convicted he could face the death penalty. 29 year old Daniel Fitzsimons was involved in a drunken argument which ended with Briton Paul McGuigan and Australian Darren Hoare being shot dead. Iraqi worker Arkhan Mahdi was shot and injured. But Daniel's father Eric and stepmother Liz say he's suffering from PTSD, post traumatic stress disorder, and should be returned to the UK to face trial.

Last week Mohammed Ali was given the freedom of Ennis and met some of his relatives. Matthew Bannister speaks to one of them.
