Adrian Street grew up in a mining town in South Wales, but he always loved dressing up. When he was a teenager he started working down the mines but his dream was to become a wrestler. He was ridiculed by the other miners he worked with but in the 1950s he moved to London to pursue his dream. He was determined and strong but he needed something else to stand out. He chose glamour. He bleached his hair blond, dressed in sequins and feather boas and dramatic make-up. The fans were shocked at first and hurled abuse at him. He embraced all their taunts and created a haughty androgynous character that would strut about the stage blowing kisses at his abusers. He confused but also fascinated the wrestling world. He called himself "Exotic Adrian Street" and it didn't take long for him to become a star. There's a new film about Adrian's life which has just been released, it's called 'You May Be Pretty, But I Am Beautiful: The Adrian Street Story' Image: Adrian Street with his father in 1974 Credit: Dennis Hutchinson/Mirrorpix/Getty Images Show less
