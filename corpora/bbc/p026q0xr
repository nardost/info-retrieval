Alain and Dafroza Gauthier devote their spare time to tracking suspected killers from the Rwandan genocide who are hiding in France. Dafroza is Rwandan, but fled the country after attacks on Tutsis. Reet Aus is an Estonian fashion designer who collects discarded garments from clothing factories and turns them into designer items. Henry Mutebe is an Outlook listener and one man NGO. He tells us how his determination to help women and children was inspired by his mother, who single-handed raised four children and three AIDS orphans. Today Henry supports dozens of children, provides training for women to become financially independent, and campaigns to keep girls in school. And a safari with a difference - when journalist Ralf Stork came back from a two-month stay in South Africa, he missed the amazing wildlife, so he created his own safari at home in Germany.
