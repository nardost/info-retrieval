Mita Rana is a Nepalese clinical psychologist and trauma counsellor. Since the earthquake she's been looking after survivors - as well as dealing with the grief of losing her own sister who died in the disaster. 70 year old Australian climber Ron Nissen was undertaking one last attempt to conquer Mount Everest when he got caught up in the earthquake. He was at Base camp when it was hit by a huge avalanche, which killed at least 22 people including Eva Girawong, the young doctor in Ron's team. Barbara Beskind is a designer at Silicon Valley company IDEO, based in California. At 91 she's at least six decades older than most of her colleagues. It's sixteen years since British artist Tracey Emin's controversial artwork 'My Bed' propelled her to global fame. The piece shows Emin's real bed at the time, complete with dirty underwear, cigarette butts and crumpled, stained sheets. It has now gone back on display in London, and is then going on a 10 year tour. Show less
