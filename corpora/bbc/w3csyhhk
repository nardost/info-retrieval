Comedian Rosie Waterland is a big name in her native Australia but it's by confronting the dark moments in her past that she's been able to reach the spotlight. She wrote a memoir called ‘The Anti Cool Girl’ about her life but when her mum read the book, she said that most of what Rosie had written was a lie. To air their grievances, Rosie decided to create a podcast with her mum. As you can imagine, in the confined space of a radio studio and amongst the laughter, things get tense. In Austria, there is a sweet story of a romance that lasted for over a hundred years. No one can be completely certain, but it's believed a love story between two tortoises called Bibi and Poldi began somewhere in the Galapagos Islands, a volcanic group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Wherever they went, they travelled as a pair and were the oldest and most popular residents of the Reptilienzoo in Austria. However, this romance mysteriously ended and no one knows why. The zoo's director Helga Happ told Outlook's Nawal Al-Maghafi all about the pair. If you’re in Lebanon anytime soon, you might see Syrian born Dima Nachawi dressed up as a clown on the streets of Beirut. Dima is also an illustrator who draws the dreams, memories and stories of her fellow Syrians. Image: Rosie Waterland Credit: Patrick Boland Show less
