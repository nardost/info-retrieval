In the world of documentary makers, Nick Broomfield is considered one of the finest. He is known for films like Kurt and Courtney, about the rock stars Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love, and Biggie and Tupac about the murders of the hip hop artists. Nick often appears in his films, holding his trademark boom microphone. His latest work is called Tales of the Grim Sleeper and investigates a 25-year-long murder spree in Los Angeles by a serial killer. Cuba is famous for its boxers. It has won more Olympic golds than any other country, and tops the amateur boxing championship table with more than three times as many wins as its nearest rival. But not all Cuban boxers are equally recognised - Namibia Flores Rodriguez is the country's only female boxer. Despite a successful Hollywood career, Maori actor Cliff Curtis is best known for his roles in the New Zealand films Once Were Warriors and Whale Rider. In his new film, The Dark Horse, he plays the real life New Zealand hero, Genesis Potini, a bi-polar speed chess champion who taught chess to local Maori youth in order to dissuade them from a life of crime and gangland violence. According to Unicef, over 20% of girls in Pakistan get married under the age of 18. It is a major issue in the Swat valley where a 14-year-old girl has started a campaign against child marriage. She lives in Mingora and works to convince parents to send their girls to school rather than marrying them off. (Picture: Documentary maker Nick Broomfield.
