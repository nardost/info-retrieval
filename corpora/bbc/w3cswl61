Martin Morales is an award-winning restaurateur who was forced to flee Peru as a child because of threats against his father by a guerrilla group. Thousands of miles from his home country he yearned for the food he had grown up with. He channelled that longing into recipes that would make him a star on the British restaurant scene. Do you have a hobby that your friends or family think is immensely boring? Maybe you like collecting beer mats or tracking weather forecasts? Well, if you do, then you might be able to join a very exclusive organisation - called the Dull Men's Club. Outlook's Mariana Des Forges gets a very interesting insight into a rather unassuming organisation. Aaron Fotheringham is a record-breaking extreme wheelchair athlete - the first person to perform a double backflip on a chair. Not something you should do without professional training, of course! Outlook's Katie Pennick has been finding out more about Aaron and his sport. And we hear from an Indian artist who - for very personal reasons - is constantly looking for the middle ground between two points. Trying to unite two places or two identities. And she does it in all sorts of media - using paint, video, installations. Her name is Nalini Malani, and much of her life has been defined by something that happened when she was just a few months old - when the British Raj was dismantled, and two independent new countries came into being - India and Pakistan.
