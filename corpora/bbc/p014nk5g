Thomas Jones was a star of the NFL, the American Football league. He retired last year after a career that saw him play for the Chicago Bears and the New York Jets and feature in the 2007 Super Bowl. Now he's producing a television series that looks at the dark side of the sport, a form of brain damage that has affected a number of players. Thomas has arranged for his own brain to be donated on his death to scientists investigating the condition. Also Lucy Ash speaks to Hania Moheeb - the Egyptian woman who refuses to be silenced after suffering a brutal attack in Cairo's Tahrir Square tells us about her ordeal. Earlier this year, Hania was snatched by a group of men who tore her clothes and sexually molested her, then even tried to get into the ambulance with her.
