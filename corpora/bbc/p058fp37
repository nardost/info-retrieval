Kechi Okwuchi was one of only two survivors of a Nigerian plane crash that killed 107 passengers and crew. She suffered horrific burns, but tells Outlook how music aided her recovery and how she got to perform on TV show America's Got Talent. Aung La N Sang lives in Baltimore, but is originally from Myanmar. In the US he's unknown, but in his native Myanmar he's known as the 'Burmese Python' for being a mixed martial arts world champion and he can't walk down the street without getting mobbed. Jean-Marie Roughol was homeless in Paris for 27 years, but tells Outlook how a chance encounter with a well-known politician helped him write a best-selling book about his life and he's now off the streets. Sabbah Haji has opened a school in a remote community high in the mountains of Jammu and Kashmir. It takes over a day to get up to the village of Breswana and everything has to be carried up either on people's backs, or by mule. The BBC's Aliya Nazki travels to the school to meet Sabbah and her students. (Picture: Kechi Okwuchi. Credit: Fremantle.) Show less
