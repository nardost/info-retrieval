The Scottish poet Robert Crawford has written Young Eliot: A biography which explores T S Eliot's life from his childhood in St Louis to publication of 'The Wasteland. He and fellow-Eliot biographer, Lyndall Gordon join Anne McElvoy to work out Eliot's enduring power and appeal while the winner of this year's TS Eliot prize David Harsent reads from his collection Fire Songs. Allan Ropper is a US neurologist who has written a book called Reaching Down The Rabbit Hole -- his description of what it's like to make a diagnosis where minds and lives hang in the balance. He talks to Anne McElvoy about the mixture of intuition and medical knowledge that every brain doctor needs. They are joined by Brian Hurwitz, Professor of Medicine and the Arts at King's College London to discuss the role of case histories over time and new importance being attached to narrative medicine.
