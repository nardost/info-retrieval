She paints buildings that have been condemned, blocks that are set to be redeveloped and streets and communities that have been overlooked. She tells reporter Matt Nelson how her motivation for capturing a particular moment comes from her experiences as a child growing up in Vienna where she and her family had to hide for months before escaping to Panama and then the United States. The Ukrainian artist Zoia Skoropadenko makes controversial art works out of octopus. She shapes pieces of the undersea creatures into human torsos before capturing them on canvas.
