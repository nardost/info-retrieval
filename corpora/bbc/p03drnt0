Reaksa Himm was a 13-year-old boy living in North West Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge took over the country. The brutal regime was responsible for one of the worst genocides in the twentieth century, claiming the lives of up to two million people. Among those they persecuted were the educated middle classes and their families. As a teacher, Reaksa's father soon found himself a target. The Jamaican-born photographer Neil Kenlock has made it his life's work to document the lives of black people living in the UK. Neil was part of the wave of immigration from the Caribbean to the UK in the 1960s. He settled in Brixton in South London. After experiencing racial discrimination, he became the photographer for the black rights group, the British Black Panthers, documenting their struggle for equality. Amin Ojjeh is a 17-year-old from London. His parents are from Syria and two years ago his grandparents fled from Damascus to Lebanon to avoid the conflict. So Amin began to ask himself what he could do to support other refugees. His answer was to start his own charity called HOPE - or Helping Our People Endure. The Moustache Brothers from Myanmar were sentenced to hard labour when they told jokes about the military junta, but that didn't make them stop telling jokes.
