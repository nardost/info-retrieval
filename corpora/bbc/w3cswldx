When a millionaire farmer went missing in Sweden, an inexperienced volunteer called Therese Tang was drafted in to help search for him. She had her suspicions about a member of the man's family and found an unorthodox way to get to the truth. Artist and sculptor Andrew Logan says his long-running parties are all about celebrating the sunny side of life. He's been hosting the Alternative Miss World party every few years since 1972. The party started as a tongue-in-cheek riposte to the Miss World pageants. Our reporter Asya Fouks went to meet him. Image: Therese Tang Credit: Suvad Mrkonic Show less
