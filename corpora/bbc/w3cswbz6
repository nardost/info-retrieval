Christchurch is the largest city in the South Island of New Zealand. As it strives to recover from the devastation caused by two earthquakes, blind broadcaster Peter White has taken his microphone to the city. Local people have been asked to choose the best use for areas which have been destroyed now that the rubble has been cleared. And Peter wanders into a field of dancing Kiwis, all with headphones connected to a vast washing machine like structure. It is an open air disco - of sorts - to revive the spirit of the city and restart its pulse. Peter listens to stories of loss, but also of dramatic escapes and the sounds that continue to endure, like the trams and the trains. He explores new buildings, including a paper Cathedral and given the local appetite for dare devil adventures, he agrees to roll up his trousers in search of marine life!
