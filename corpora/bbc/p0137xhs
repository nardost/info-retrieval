The British war photographer Paul Conroy was working in the besieged Syrian city of Homs with the newspaper correspondent Marie Colvin when they came under intense fire from government forces in February last year. Marie was killed, along with the French journalist Remi Ochlik, and Paul was seriously injured. Eventually Paul managed to get out of the war-torn city through a secret tunnel, with the help of the Free Syrian Army. He tells Matthew Bannister about his dramatic escape.
