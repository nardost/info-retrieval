Allison Moorer is an Oscar-nominated country music star. But shaping her lyrics and music are the traumatic deaths of both of her parents, in a murder-suicide, when she was just a teenager. She speaks to Emily Webb about why she's decided to tell the story decades later and why sad songs are the best songs. Allison has just released a book and an album both called Blood.
