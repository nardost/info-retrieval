Beyond Terror and Martyrdom: The Future of the Middle East is published by Harvard University Press. Did you know that there are four full-scale enclaves left in Western Europe?

Journalist and writer VITALI VITALIEV argues that these places are a forum for examining our notions of identity and nationality and are a symbol of cross-cultural collaboration.
