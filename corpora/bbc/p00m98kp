A selection of our 60 second ideas, our regular slot where we ask programme guests to imagine they have a magic wand, and tell us what they would do to make the world a better place. The British artist Antony Gormley calls for us all to walk barefoot, the American satirist P.J. O'Rourke proposes a very unusual device to force children to listen, and the Serbian economist Branko Milanovic argues taxi drivers should rule the world. To discuss these suggestions are the animal behaviourist and former chief scientific advisor to the British government, Lord Robert May, the physicist and authority on music, Philip Ball, the poet and film maker Imtiaz Dharker, and the Executive Producer of the Forum, Emily Kasriel who came up with the idea of this 60 second manifesto.
