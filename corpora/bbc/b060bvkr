Last Broadcast Date: Wed 1 Jul 2015
Choreographer, Siobhan Davies, the artist, Jeremy Millar and the neurologist, Jonathan Cole join Philip Dodd to explore the links between art, dance and the brain. Bloodied but unbowed Philip will then turn his attention to the question of what we mean when we talk about "the public". He'll be spurred on by Danielle Thom, a 2015 New Generation Thinker, who'll be reflecting on the emergence of the idea in the 18th century. Then American anthropologist David Graeber, who lectures at the London School of Economics and the psychotherapist and writer Mark Vernon consider who or indeed what qualifies as the public today. Siobhan Davies is in residency between 12pm and 6pm July 4th - 10th at Station to Station - a 30 day happening curated by artist Doug Aitken at the Barbican in London. David Graeber is the author of The Democracy Project: a history, a crisis, a movement and The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy Siobhan Davies Dance in Station to Station: A 30 Day Happening.
