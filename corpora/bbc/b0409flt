Program: Letter from America by Alistair Cooke
Title: The United Nations
Link: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0409flt
Last Broadcast Date: Sun 23 Oct 1977
As the UN grows into a sprawling organisation, is it failing to achieve its original aims? The sound quality of this programme deteriorates heavily towards the end due to the nature of how it was recorded. This archive edition of Letter from America was recorded by one of two listeners, who between them taped and labelled over 650 Letter From America programmes from 1973 to 1989. It was restored by the BBC in 2014. Show less
