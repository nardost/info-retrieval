When Maria Gallant's baby daughter Gail died after a car crash, Maria prayed for God to give back her child. Within a year she had another daughter - she also called her Gail. Maria brought her up to believe that she was her sister reborn. Gail told Jo Fidgen about the impact this had on her throughout her life. She has written a book about her experiences called The Changeling. Grecia is a toucan from Costa Rica whose beak had been purposely crushed and completely amputated, but animal rescue expert Ronald Sibaja was determined to save Grecia’s life. Ronald didn’t work alone, he got support from an unlikely source - from US and Costa Rican 3D printing companies that normally fabricate noses for commercial aircrafts. Outlook’s Clayton Conn spoke to Ronald Sibaja and to 3D printing engineer Karley Fu who helped create a prosthetic beak for Grecia. Mirna Valerio a.k.a.
