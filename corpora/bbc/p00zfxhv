Do you have a guilty secret that keeps you tossing and turning at night? Or do you sleep easy with a clear conscience? The Forum's subject this week is guilt: how much does it affect the behaviour of individuals, families and entire nations? Joining Bridget Kendall this week are Australian novelist and author of Schindler's List, Thomas Keneally, Turkish historian Taner Akcam and Jordanian writer Fadia Faqir.
