Martin Murray is a boxer, with British and Commonwealth titles to his name, and an eye on the world title in his category. But back when he was younger he used to get into a lot of trouble. When he won his first big title, fifteen years ago, he was on the run from the law. He had been convicted of street robbery, and was serving the last part of his sentence at home when he decided to give the police the slip. He has since written a book about how he turned his life around called Sinner and Saint. In the Indian city of Agra there is a group of women who have all been through the unimaginable trauma of an acid attack, and together they have formed the tightest of bonds. They run a cafe now, and Outlook's Sumiran Preet Kaur has been to meet them. Tato Getia is the owner of a nightclub in Tbilisi, Georgia, that has recently been at the centre of a lot of drama. Back in spring it was shut down by the police, sparking huge protests that took the form of a rave. Like all World War One casualties, Belgian Maite Roel receives a war pension from her government. The surprising thing is her age. Maite is just 40 years old and was born six decades after the war ended. She is classed as a World War One casualty because of a childhood injury she sustained from an unexploded bomb found in a military base. (Image: Martin Murray.
