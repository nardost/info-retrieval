Kimi Werner grew up on the tropical Hawaiian island of Maui and began learning to dive when she was six years old. Now she's a champion freediver - which means she dives without any breathing apparatus. In fact Kimi can hold her breath for over four minutes. She's also a trained chef and mostly dives to catch sea creatures to feed herself and her friends. Jack Cooke is an English man who has swapped his suit and office job for a life exploring the world from the tops of trees. He is determined to get other people to share his passion, and spend more time climbing trees. As a huge multi-national effort to find missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 continues, a retired American lawyer is on a one man mission to solve the mystery. Blaine Alan Gibson from Seattle, has spent much of the last year travelling at his own expense to remote beaches in the Indian Ocean looking for debris from the plane. And amazingly, in February, Blaine came across a piece of wreckage in Mozambique that the investigating authorities have concluded is highly likely to be from MH370. Ofir Drori was canoeing in a remote part of Ethiopia when he was attacked by a huge crocodile which also destroyed his boat. Injured and alone he was forced to crawl for two days to reach help. Lisa Hallett has created a running phenomenon. Her group has 15,000 members who meet across the United States on the weekends and also hold races and running events. Many come from military families and running means much more to them them than just keeping fit. The inspiration behind all this is Lisa's husband, John.
