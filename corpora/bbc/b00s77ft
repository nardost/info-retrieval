Sir Stuart Rose, chairman of Marks and Spencer, chooses the cartographer Matthew Flinders for Great Lives. Flinders mapped Australia two hundred years ago in His Majesty's ship the Investigator. "Since neither birth nor fortune have favoured me," he wrote, "my actions shall speak to the world." Sir Stuart Rose clearly finds inspiration in what Flinders achieved and the way he led his men. Rose also reveals that his first ambition was to join the Royal Navy, and that he applied to 25 companies before Marks and Spencer took him on. Dr Nigel Rigby of the National Maritime Museum offers the expert's view on Flinders life and Matthew Parris presents. The producer is Miles Warde. Show less
