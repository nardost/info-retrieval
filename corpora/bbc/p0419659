Dr. Nabil-Iosif Morad is from the Syrian city of Homs but, in his current role as a town mayor in Greece, he is housing refugees in an abandoned tourist resort. At the age of 14, Collin Smith was involved in a car accident that left him quadriplegic, without the use of his arms or legs. When 64-year-old Ernest Greene heard what had happened, he decided he wanted to help Collin. They went on to become an unlikely duo. The bodybuilder and power lifter Sajad Gharibi has been nicknamed the Iranian Hulk and the Persian Hercules. His massive muscles have drawn 170,000 followers on social media where he regularly posts pictures of himself with his shirt off. The Chilean architect Alejandro Aravena won the 2016 Pritzker prize - the highest accolade in architecture. He has designed buildings for Chile's Catholic University and a futuristic writer's cabin in Switzerland. But he is best known for his social housing projects in Chile which, for the first time ever, involved residents with the design of their own homes.
