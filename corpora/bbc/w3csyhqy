When Lis Cashin was 13, she took part in a javelin competition in her school sports day. But in a freak accident, the javelin veered off course, and a friend of hers was killed. Lis has spent decades trying to deal with the tragedy, and learning how to forgive herself. She tells her story to Jo Fidgen. Slobodan Simić is a former Serbian parliamentarian turned donkey farmer. He runs a nature reserve which produces a rare delicacy - Balkan donkey cheese. Priced at over $1,000 per kilogram, this cheese is possibly the most expensive in the world. Virpi and Tuomo Pekkanen are a Finnish couple with a shared passion for ancient languages. They’ve spent 30 years broadcasting the news in Latin Image: Lis Cashin Credit: James Muller Show less
