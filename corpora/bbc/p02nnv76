Erwiana Sulistyaningsih moved from Indonesia to work as a maid in Hong Kong. For eight months she was abused and forced to work for twenty hours each day. Eventually she escaped and her employer was taken to court. Thousands of people took to the streets of Hong Kong to demonstrate in support of Erwiana. Her employer was sentenced to 6 years in prison and fined two thousand dollars. The judgement is being seen as a landmark case. Mango Groove are an 11 piece Afro Pop band from South Africa who have sold more than a million records and had 12 number one hits back home. In the 1980s and '90s they were a rarity because they had both black and white members. John Leyden, who was originally from Zambia, co-founded the band in 1984 in Johannesburg. Soon afterwards he was joined by lead singer Claire Johnston, who at the time was studying at the University of the Witwatersrand. Noa Mintz was so fed up with the quality of babysitter her parents hired to look after her that three years ago she started her own nanny agency. Business boomed and today it's turning over hundreds of thousands of dollars. Noa is still only 15 years old and has even hired a Chief Executive to take on the day to day running of the company. Love it or loathe it, the selfie stick is everywhere. You might think it's a recent invention but in fact a Japanese camera engineer called Hiroshi Ueda developed an early version of the selfie stick - called the extender - more than 30 years ago. The idea came to him after a holiday that went wrong. Picture credit: Philippe Lopez/AFP/Getty Images. Show less
