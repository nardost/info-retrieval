PLES AND AZIM Tariq Khamisa was just twenty when he was shot dead while delivering pizzas. The trigger was pulled by Tony Hicks who was only fourteen years old. Tony's now serving a long prison sentence. Tony's grandfather, Ples Felix, and Tariq's father, Azim Khamisa, joined forces to try to stop young people getting involved with guns. Azim set up a foundation in honour of his son, and the two 61-year-olds go into schools to talk to children about the violent reality of gang life. Jo Fidgen hears their story. DR RUTH PFAU Dr Ruth Pfau is an 81 year old German nun, who ended up in Pakistan over fifty years ago while waiting for a visa. When she saw the devastating effects of leprosy in Pakistan she made up her mind to stay, and now her organisation offers treatment in over 150 leprosy clinics all across the country. Her efforts paid off in 1996 when leprosy was finally deemed to be under control. But Dr Pfau continues to work tirelessly and is seen by many as the Mother Teresa of Pakistan. For Outlook Mark Lobel goes to meet Dr Pfau as she helps the forgotten victims of the Pakistan floods. Show less
