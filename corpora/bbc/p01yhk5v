During the apartheid years Archbishop Desmond Tutu was known globally for his vocal opposition to white minority rule - and his famously good humour. Now he and his daughter - the Reverend Mpho Tutu - have written The Book of Forgiving - a guide to the process of forgiveness. Egyptian archaeologist Monica Hanna explains why she is tackling the looters who have been targeting Egypt's antiquities since the uprising three years ago. Retired teacher Antonio La Cava converted his three-wheeled vehicle into a library to take books to Italian villages. Milos Karadaglic's drive and talent as a classical guitar-player took him from Montenegro to top teachers in London to an international career. His latest album is called Aranjuez. British writer Diana Darke bought an old house in Damascus which has now become a refuge for Syrians sheltering from the civil war. Her book is called My House in Damascus: An Inside View of the Syrian Revolution. Picture credit: Oryx Media 2013 Show less
