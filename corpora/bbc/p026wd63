Talu Tshiwandimoni was trapped for 14 hours in the rubble of a collapsed "mega-church" guesthouse in Lagos. Around 115 people died in the incident, many had travelled to Nigeria from South Africa. Talu speaks to Jo Fidgen about his ordeal. James Ward is a British man with a very unusual obsession - stationery. He loves pens, paper, staplers, and paperclips so much that he has written a book about it. Florentijn Hofman is a Dutch artist who has made a career out of giant rubber ducks. His bright yellow ducks typically inflate to over 18 metres and weigh several hundred kilos. He is now branching out into other animals and recently floated a huge hippopotamus on the River Thames in London. Davi Kopenawa is from the Yanomami tribe in Brazil's Amazon rainforest. He remembers when 'the white men' came, bringing with them diseases that killed his father and mother. Davi became a Shaman and embarked on a mission to defend his tribe from further attack. In Tel Aviv, a group of Israeli veterans have formed a rock band - Nine Lives - as a way of dealing with psychological trauma caused by their military service. Camilla Schick went to meet them.
