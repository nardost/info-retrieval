We meet an ordinary Kenyan woman who has done an extraordinary thing and opened her home to 49 orphaned children. Rachel Gichia is one of an increasing number of Kenyans who are stepping forward to adopt or care for children in need. The programme explores her motives and finds out how she copes, but also discovers that the situation is more complicated than it first appears. (Image Credit: Kate Holt) Show less
