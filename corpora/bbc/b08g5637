Worlds within worlds - Matthew Sweet talks to filmmaker and author Neil Jordan about his new novel Carnivalesque, which features a hall of mirrors and stolen children. He makes a tour of Flat Time House in south London and speaks to the Turner Prize-winning artist Laure Prouvost and curator Gareth Bell-Jones about the house's creator, the pioneering British conceptual artist John Latham (1921-2006). And to round things off, he ventures into the lush green world of the Teletubbies with broadcaster Samira Ahmed and child psychologist Sam Wass to explore the show's enduring fascination twenty years after it first appeared on television. Neil Jordan's latest novel is called Carnivalesque. A World View: John Latham is on at London's Serpentine Gallery from March 2nd to May 21st and includes a series of events at http://flattimeho.org.uk/ Producer Zahid Warley. Show less
