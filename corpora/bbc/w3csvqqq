Starting in 2005, he forced her into sex work and subjected her to violent and degrading treatment. However, after 18 months she was able to make her escape. Dorris Francis' daughter died in a traffic accident on a busy Indian intersection.

Her courage earned her an award as part of our Outlook Inspirations in 2016. She tells us how the award changed her life. When he was just 11 years old, Mark Baker from Wales, started a campaign to save a historic local castle, which was falling into disrepair. He wrote to the Prime Minister and the Prince of Wales who helped him restore the building to its former glory. Image: Shamere McKenzie Credit: Shamere McKenzie Show less
