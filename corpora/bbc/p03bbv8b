Shahidha traces the story of the sari, explores how it feels to wear one and asks what it meant for women like her mother. She talks with a range of women, including broadcaster Mishal Husain and writer Monica Ali about their experiences. And she explores the powerful, painful, sometimes complicated relationships between mother and daughters, and discovers the unexpected ways in which clothing can be imprinted with feelings of nostalgia, love and loss, whichever background we come from.
