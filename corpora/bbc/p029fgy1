Fred Abrahams, the American founder of the Emergencies Team of the pressure group Human Rights Watch describes how he and a team of investigators head into war zones like Iraq and Syria to gather evidence of breaches of international law. Their aim is to bring war criminals to justice. South African martial arts champion, Debi Steven runs a charity which has trained 10,000 Indian women and girls in self defence. Debi was inspired to take up martial arts after being raped as a child. Zimbabwe's mushroom farming campaigner Chido Govera on how she overcame poverty by learning to grow food and create profit for herself. Chimpanzee saviour Eugene Cussons on how he has devoted his life to saving the animals. He grew up on a nature reserve in South Africa, and started work as a supplier of financial software until, in 2006, he created a sanctuary for abused chimps called "Chimpanzee Eden". He has travelled the world rescuing chimpanzees and taking them back to South Africa for rehabilitation. Left-handed pianist Leon Fleisher on why he was once described as "the pianistic find of the century". Until his mid thirties he enjoyed a high profile concert career. But then the fingers on his right hand started to cramp and curl under. It was eventually diagnosed as a condition called focal dystonia. Leon was forced to make a new career for himself as a conductor, teacher and champion of left handed piano music. Photo: Fred Abrahams and Eugene Cussons Show less
