Sean Laidlaw rescued Barrie from Syria in 2018 where he was working as a bomb disposal expert. He fought a long and difficult battle to get her home to the UK to be with him and since, the two have become inseparable. He tells Outlook's Saskia Edwards how Barrie is helping him overcome his PTSD. He has written a book about their relationship called 'Barrie: How a rescue dog and her owner saved each other.' Dominique GÃ¶rlitz is an experimental archaeologist. He builds replicas of ancient boats to prove that they were seaworthy. When she was 17 years old, Piera Aiello was forced to marry into a notorious Sicilian Mafia family. After witnessing the murder of her husband, she became a police informant. However, the decision meant she had to go into hiding - giving up her name, her family, and wearing a veil when she went outside. Now, after 25 years, Piera has decided to show her face in public for the first time. Picture: Sean Laidlaw and Barrie in Syria Supplied by Sean Laidlaw Show less
