On New Year's Eve 2013, Dr Kate Stone was out celebrating in rural Scotland when she was gored by a deer. However, when she came out of the coma she had an even greater shock - seeing some of the headlines about her in the national press. Going to a public bathhouse used to be a big part of the culture in Japan but they aren’t as popular these days. One man, Yuichi Tamura, is trying to bring them back and in an unusual way. Yuichi offers classes on all sorts of aspects of Japanese culture at his bathhouse… but students attend naked. Outlook’s Alessia Cerantola has been to meet the founder. Daniel Lofredo Rota is an Ecuadorian DJ and musician on a quest to unravel a decade-old family mystery. His eccentric grandfather has left a clue: a grimy, battered suitcase filled with old tapes. Inside are songs, secret loves, and the resurrection of a long-lost record label. Image: Dr Kate Stone Credit: Novalia Show less
