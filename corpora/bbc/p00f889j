DANIEL HERNANDEZ JUNIOR When American Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the head in January this year, it was her new intern Daniel Hernandez Junior who ran to her aid. He tells us how an ordinary event in a supermarket carpark was turned into a bloodbath, with six people killed and many injured. SHANDER HERIAN When Shander Herian was ten years old, he suffered a rare allergic reaction which led to him losing his sight. Shander - who lives in the British Midlands - did well at school and went on to become a successful businessman in partnership with his sighted wife. He tells us what happened when, twenty years later, a pioneering operation restored his sight, and he saw his wife and daughters for the first time. Show less
