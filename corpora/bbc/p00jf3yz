Matthew Bannister tells the story of Amnesty International at 50, and discusses its future on the world stage. He examines the position it currently holds in the field of global human rights, and assesses the international influence its many campaigns, and both Nobel and UN prizes, have brought it. In part one, Matthew asks how Amnesty has succeeded since its creation 50 years ago, and examines how the organisation was born and what it originally set out to achieve. He talks to early volunteers and researchers to discover how Amnesty set out to be a pioneer, both in the field of human rights, and in the methods it has developed as a charitable campaigner on a global stage.
