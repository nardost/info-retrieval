16 million Americans served in World War Two, but, according to official figures, they are now dying at a rate of 372 a day....so 19-year-old Rishi Sharma from California is in a race against time. Ever since he read a book about a platoon of 18 American soldiers who fought off 500 Germans, Rishi has been obsessed with recording the stories of World War Two veterans. He travels the entire country to do it, and so far has talked to 350 former soldiers. Singer Steve Kekana is one of the first black performers to have his music played on a white radio station in South Africa, at a time when apartheid was still in force and the music industry was segregated along racial lines. He went on to become one of South Africa's most celebrated musicians. But his success was even more remarkable because music wasn't the obvious career choice for him as a child: at the age of five Steve became blind because of an illness, and worked as a cattle herder. He tells Outlook's Mpho Lakaje his story. And British adventurer Jamie McDonald tells us all about his epic journey: in 2013 he ran 5,000 miles across Canada dressed as a superhero. He covered the equivalent of more than 200 back to back marathons through forbidding weather and across challenging and mountainous terrain. As a child, Jamie spent almost 9 years in and out of hospital due to a condition that affected his immune system and his mobility. So while running this marathon, he raised over a quarter of a million pounds for children's hospitals in the UK and in Canada. His book is called: Adventureman: Anyone can be a superhero.
