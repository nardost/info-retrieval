On the 50th anniversary of the first Moon landings, Beatriz De La Pava researches how real life events are reflected in the lyrics of popular songs, and shows how music can paint a vivid picture of the social, political, economic, and cultural landscape. From Frank Sinatraâ€™s Fly Me to the Moon, when reaching outer space was merely a metaphor for love, through to the Apollo 11 mission; narrated by bands like The Byrds and Public Service Broadcasting. From the journey of the first woman into space, to the tragic accident of the Columbia shuttle, immortalized by Deep Purple finishing the ride with the exploration of Mars, which has now become a reality that is reflected in music. De La Pava plays the music that chronicles the history of the space race, and speaks to the people who knew it, made it and loved it. Image: Music on the Moon (Credit: BBC) Show less
