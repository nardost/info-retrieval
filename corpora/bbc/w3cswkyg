Carlos Cano was part of a right-wing Colombian paramilitary group called the AUC, an armed organisation which was accused of numerous war crimes during its long fight against left-wing Farc guerillas. He was eventually caught in an ambush by the authorities, and while imprisoned he decided to start working towards reconciliation. Carlos is now a maths teacher, and with former enemies among his pupils, he's had to work hard for acceptance. Sherrie Silver is the 23-year-old Rwandan-British choreographer who masterminded the dance moves for This is America - a hugely popular and hugely controversial song by rapper Childish Gambino, aka Donald Glover. Chris Packham is one of the UK's most famous wildlife experts. He's a familiar face on televisions around the country, but many viewers are unaware of the challenges Chris overcomes every time he broadcasts. He lives with Asperger syndrome, a condition on the autism spectrum that sometimes makes social interaction difficult. He uses his love of nature to help communicate with others.
