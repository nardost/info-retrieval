Astrologer and performer Russell Grant chooses one of the greatest screen legends of cinema's early years – Ivor Novello. Born in 1893 in Cardiff, Novello was also a talented writer and composer and would dominate both screen and stage with his epic romantic fantasies, until his death in 1951. Russell is joined by Richard Stirling, author of the stage biography of Novello, 'Love, from Ivor', and the adaptor of one of Novello's last productions, ‘Gay's the Word’. Presented by Matthew Parris. Produced by Lizz Pearson. First broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2013. Show less
