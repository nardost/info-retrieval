Stan Brock grew up on the south coast of England, but he was always interested in adventure and ended up working as a cowboy in Guyana. He tells Matthew Bannister how falling off a horse led him to an extraordinary life flying free medical care to millions of people around the world. Levi Hanssen is a semi-professional footballer from the Faroe islands - halfway between Norway and Iceland. He also works for the tourist board there and was so keen for the language of the Faroe Islands to be preserved that he started his very own translating project. He tells us how he did it. In 2013 Robert Burn was stranded on a remote island off the coast of Australia after a crocodile destroyed his rubber boat. He, and the woman with him, decided to make a giant SOS message out of rocks to signal to any planes. They were stranded for eight days until they were rescued by a passing boat. In their haste to escape they didn't remove the SOS. When it was discovered four years later, the police had no idea who'd left it....until now. For the first time Robert tells his story to the world. Mosha is the first elephant in the world to have a prosthetic leg. She lost her leg after stepping on a landmine on the Thai-Myanmar border, but an orthopaedic surgeon called Dr Therdchai Jivacate came to the rescue and created a prosthetic leg for her. For Outlook, reporter Aurora Almendral went to meet them. Image: Stan Brock Credit: Auston James Show less
