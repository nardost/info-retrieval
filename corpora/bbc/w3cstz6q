Rohan Marley grew up in the shadow of a star: his father, reggae legend Bob Marley. When Bob died from cancer in 1981, Rohan went off the rails. He ended up skipping school and was eventually expelled. He got his life back on track and went on to become a star in American football. After embracing Rastafarianism, he left sport and ended up starting a coffee company in his native Jamaica. Correction: we said Rohan played NFL, in fact he was a professional American football player in Canada. London is a city rich in canals and waterways. If you take a walk down the Regent's Canal, just behind King's Cross train station, you might bump into a boat covered in ivy and books. It's the home of book enthusiast Jonathan Privett, who has been bringing literature to unexpected places for most part of his life. Back in May 2012, Aimee Copeland was 19 and loved the outdoors. She rock climbed, mountain biked and was working as a waitress to pay her way through graduate school. But one day, when she was out hiking with friends, she fell and was infected with flesh-eating bacteria. She lost her hands, a leg and a foot, but says the traumatic experience has made her a better person. She wants to redefine the concept of beauty.

He looked at ways he could change his life and turned to running. After escaping human trafficking, Moninda now competes in the US. He also runs an athletics camp for schoolchildren. And, recently, Moninda also had a run-in with two rather large black bears. Image: Rohan Marley Credit: Lou Bopp Show less
