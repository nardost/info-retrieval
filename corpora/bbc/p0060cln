Border Crime and Corruption San Ysidro is the busiest border crossing in the world. Ninety five thousand people make the trip between Mexico and the United States every day. The border is protected by increasingly high security, yet this has created a new wave of crime as Mexican traffickers turn to corrupting border police to smuggle drugs and immigrants. Keith Slotter - head of the FBI in San Diego - spoke to Outlook and described the latest trouble at the border. Mothering 40 Children Amina Adjibayeva is a devout Muslim from a Chinese refugee family in Kazakhstan. She made money in the restaurant trade but decided to put all her profits into starting her own orphanage, which she runs herself, acting as surrogate mother to 40 children. Rayhan Demytrie went to meet her and some of the many children she has in her care. Wolf Man Animal behaviour expert Shaun Ellis spent 18 months living with a pack of wolves in the Rocky Mountains in America. He learnt to depend on them for survival and to behave like a low-ranking member of the pack, sleeping rough and eating raw meat. He spoke to Lucy Ash and described his lupine life in the wild. The Man Who Lives with Wolves by Shaun Ellis is published by Harper Collins. Show less
