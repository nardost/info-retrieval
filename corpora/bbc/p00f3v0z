AMY COONEY The earthquake that hit the city of Christchurch last month killed more than one hundred and sixty people and injured many more. When the quake struck, Amy Cooney and her brother Jaime Gilbert were just starting their shift working together as managers in a local bar. By the end of the day Jamie was dead and Amy had been rescued from the rubble of the building which had collapsed on top of them. The family were left in shock. Amy has since set up a fund for Jaime's children. She tells Matthew Bannister how she held Jamie's hand as he died. LEPROSY COLONY The village of Tichilesti in Romania is home to what's thought to be Europe's last remaining leprosy colony. Since leprosy has largely been eradicated in Europe, the population of the colony has dwindled and now only a handful of patients are left. The oldest of them is Ioana Miscov, who was sent to the colony as a young child. Ioana married a fellow patient and had a daughter called Dominica, who grew up there. Our reporter Tom Wilson has been to visit them. JERRY WINKLER 28 year-old Jerry Winkler is the Dutch down-and-out and former drug addict who suddenly discovered last year that he was the only son and heir of a multi-millionaire businessman. Now he lives in a well appointed house in the centre of Amsterdam and is using his new found wealth to help other homeless people. He tells us how his life has been transformed. Show less
