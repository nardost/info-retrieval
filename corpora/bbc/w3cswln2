Before Baruch died at 25 years old from cancer he said that he wanted to have a child. So he created something called a 'biological will' and gave a sperm sample. But Baruch didn't have a wife or girlfriend. So after he passed away, his mother began a seven-year campaign to find a woman to have his baby. She found Liat who was 35 years old and single. But there are many emotional and ethical issues involved in posthumous reproduction. So, would they be able to fulfil Baruch's dying wish? Michael Fuller was Britainâ€™s first ever black Chief Constable and headed up the police force in the English county of Kent. But to get there he not only had to battle racism on the streets, but in the police force itself. (Photo: A mother and child. Credit: Aleksandar Nakic/Getty Images) Show less
