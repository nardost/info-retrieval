Andrew Marr looks at the lasting impact of the British Empire with Jeremy Paxman and Richard Gott. Paxman reflects on how our imperial past still has the power to influence everything from Prime Ministers' decisions to send troops to war, to the way we view adventurers of the past. While Gott argues against any residual belief that the Empire was an imaginative and civilising enterprise, and reveals the brutality at its heart. The social entrepreneur Mari√©me Jamme believes it's time for Africa to leave behind its colonised past, and with Africa's share of global trade on the rise, she asks whether this is her continent's decade. China's Empire once ruled over a third of the world's population, and the film-maker Suyun Sun is embarking on a major history series on China which she hopes will cast new light on the country.
