In the United States, religion - in particular Christianity - is a driving force behind African-American culture. Under slavery and segregation, the black church provided both spiritual and social services to African-Americans. Today, many African-Americans see anything short of embracing religion as not just heretical but a denial of one's very blackness. But there are a growing number of African-Americans who openly don't believe in God or the church. We find out how they are trying to make their voices heard and seeking acceptance in their community. Contributors to the documentary include writer Sikivu Hutchinson and musician Landon Taylor.
