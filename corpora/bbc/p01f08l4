Also Kenyan novelist Mukoma Wa Ngugi on the advantages of coming from a family of famous writers; the British cancer survivor Ian Clements who's been tracking his life in numbers for over 40 years, and; a British family who were held hostage at a chemical factory by the Iraqi government in the run up to the first gulf war in 1990 remember their ordeal.
