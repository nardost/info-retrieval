Tom Houck was just 19 years old when he was asked by Dr Martin Luther King's wife to be a driver for their family. It was 1965 and although Dr King had been awarded the Nobel peace prize the year before the country was deeply divided. Widespread segregation between the white and African-American citizens had just come to an end but discrimination and racism were still commonplace. Tom continues to combine activism and driving in his work now, running Civil Rights Tours Atlanta. Sohail Yafat is from Lahore, part of the Pakistani cityâ€™s minority Christian community. In 2001, Sohail was imprisoned for murder. But he didn't know who he was supposed to have killed. What followed was a fight for justice and one prison's first Christmas party.
