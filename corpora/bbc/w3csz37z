When Alex Lewis was 18 he had an accident that caused him to lose his memory. The only person he could remember was Marcus, his identical twin brother. He became the person Alex most relied upon to rebuild his life and memories. But as it turned out not everything Marcus told him was true. This interview contains themes of child sexual abuse which may be difficult and triggering to hear. Their story features in a documentary called ‘Tell me who I am’ directed by Ed Perkins, released on Netflix and in select cinemas from Friday 18th October.
