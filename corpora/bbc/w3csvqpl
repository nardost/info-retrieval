Zohra Bensemra was chosen by Britain's Guardian newspaper as the best photographer of 2017. Zohra is from Algeria, but her work has captured the conflict in Iraq, the fight against so-called Islamic State in Syria, and the drought in Somalia. However, it turns out that she hadn't planned to be a war photographer, or even a photographer, until Algeria was plunged into civil war. Louise Gray is a British environmental journalist who wrote a book a couple of years ago about meat, and its effect on climate change. It did extremely well last year at the 'foodies' equivalent of the Oscars, the Guild of Food Writers Awards. But at the same time Louise felt like an imposter because for 20 years she had struggled with eating as she was living with bulimia. Keanon Kyles is a janitor in the US city of Chicago. But he's also an opera singer. Keanon was discovered singing at the news station he works at and that exposure led him to perform on stages in Europe. In the Colombian capital, Bogota, as in many parts of the world, people with disabilities face discrimination. One of the reasons for that was a belief that disabilities were a punishment from God.
