Real Madrid are the world's most valuable football club. They are the reigning European champions and have won more European Cups than any other club in history. Now they have opened their doors and their books to outside scrutiny for the first time, giving Columbia Business School professor Steven Mandis unprecedented access to every part of the business. How does an organisation co-owned by 92,000 fans operate? How was the club transformed from the brink of bankruptcy 16 years ago? What is the relationship between success on the pitch and off the pitch? What role do values play in the business? What lessons are there for other sports teams and for businesses more widely? Through conversations with fans, players, coaches and board members - including a rare in-depth interview with club president Florentino Perez - professor Mandis uncovers the secrets of Real Madrid's sporting and financial success.
