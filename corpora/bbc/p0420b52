Nia Vardalos wrote and starred in the biggest grossing romantic comedy of all time. And the film was based on her own family. My Big Fat Greek Wedding told the true - and hilarious - story of Nia introducing her non-Greek fiance into her large, eccentric and at times overbearing family. And now there's a sequel. Nia's character and her husband have a teenage daughter called Paris, who's trying to decide whether to choose a local university or move further away to escape her family. Patron Palushang has always loved to make musical instruments. And even though he had to flee from his home in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he kept on making guitars. He started his own business in a camp for displaced people in Malawi, earning himself the title of the 'Refugee Guitar Maker'. Patron and his family have just found a new home in the Australian city of Adelaide. Judith Kerr is one of Britain's best loved authors and illustrators. She escaped Nazi Germany as a child in the early 1930s with her family and went on to publish over 30 children's stories including The Tiger Who Came to Tea and her series about a cat called Mog. She's now received a lifetime achievement award. Judith is 93. She's been living in the London home she shared with her late husband, the science fiction writer, Tom Nigel Kneale, since 1962.
