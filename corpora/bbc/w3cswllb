Tyler Wetherall had lived in 13 houses in five countries before she was ten years old. But as a child she didn't think this was remarkable. Then the police came and she found out her father wasn't what he seemed - he was a fugitive on the run from the FBI. In 2015 Mohammed Al Samawi found himself living in the middle of a warzone in Yemen. His friends and family were unable to help and so he turned to social media where a group of strangers offered to help him. One of those who guided Mohammed to safety was an American man called Justin Hefter. (Picture: Tyler Wetherall. Photo credit: Sammy Deigh.) Show less
