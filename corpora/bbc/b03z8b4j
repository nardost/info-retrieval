Link: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03z8b4j
Last Broadcast Date: Sun 16 Dec 1973
Nixon makes past tax returns public to quell claims of tax evasion - but his minimal returns don't quite add up. This archive edition of Letter from America was recorded by one of two listeners, who between them taped and labelled over 650 Letter From America programmes from 1973 to 1989. It was restored by the BBC in 2014. Show less
