On 14 June 2017, a fire broke out in the 24-storey Grenfell Tower block of flats in West London; it caused 72 deaths and more than 70 others were injured and 223 people escaped. On the fourteenth floor of Grenfell Tower, firefighters moved eight residents into one flat â€“ 113. Only four would survive. Piecing together evidence from phase one of the Grenfell Tower Public Inquiry, Katie Razzell tries to understand what went wrong that night in flat 113. The answer reveals a catalogue of errors which could help explain the wider disaster. (Photo: The charred remains of Grenfell Tower after the fire on 16 June 2017. Credit: Getty Images) Show less
