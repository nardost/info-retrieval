Jason Russell was behind the video Kony 2012, which at the time was called the most viral of all time. But with the fame also came the scrutiny that led Jason to have a breakdown. ‘Dad dancing’ has become a bit of a phenomenon, in the UK at least, and has even got an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary, which describes it as ‘an awkward, unfashionable, or unrestrained style of dancing to pop music, as characteristically performed by middle-aged or older men’. It is not cool. Or it wasn’t cool before OMG came along. OMG stands for Old Men Grooving, and they became stars of British TV with their dad dance routines. We meet OMG dancers, Fred Folkes and and Bret Jones. In the middle of the Sulu Sea, between the Philippines and Indonesia, there’s a tiny island called Lankayan. It's only about the size of ten football pitches, but it's become a sanctuary for several marine species. Ivana Davidovic has been to meet Davies Austin Spiji, the man in charge of protecting the island.
