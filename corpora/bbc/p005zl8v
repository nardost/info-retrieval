Justice for Ruchika Girhotra Two decades ago, a 14 year Indian girl alleged that she had been molested by the president of her tennis club, S.P.S. Rathore, who was also a senior police officer. Ruchika Girhotra's family claimed he used his influence to harrass them when they lodged a complaint against him, which he denies. Ruchika later committed suicide, and we hear from childhood friend Aradhana Prakash about her long campaign to bring Mr Rathore to justice. Childhood obesity in America As Michelle Obama spearheads a campaign against childhood obesity in the United States, we hear from eleven-year-old Dawson MacKay, who has been battling obesity since the age of eight. He is now an advisor to the Alliance for a Healthier Generation.

It follows five Iraqi women on a photography course in Damascus, and shows how the pictures they take give them a better understanding of each other, and of their own lives. Show less
