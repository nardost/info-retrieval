British songwriter Guy Chambers was struggling to make ends meet and couldn't afford to repair his leaking roof when he got a phone call from pop star Robbie Williams. Robbie asked him if he could write "dirty pop". Guy said yes, and Robbie showed up at his flat. Together they co-wrote some of the most enduring British pop songs of the 1990s.
