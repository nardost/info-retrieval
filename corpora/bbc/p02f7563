In many parts of the world the Christmas season is under way - a time to exchange gifts, and a lucrative annual ritual for retailers. Do we own our possessions or is there a danger that they start to own us? Why do we collect stuff? Plus, the secrets of retail therapy and clothes designed to fall apart after just ten washes. Bridget Kendall talks to Philipp Blom, Yewande Omotoso and Annamma Joy. (Photo: Christmas presents. BBC copyright) Show less
