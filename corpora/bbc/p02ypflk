Thousands of women and girls have disappeared over the past decade in the State of Mexico. Many girls are targeted online and go willingly and nobody knows how many of the missing have been found, dead or alive. Some families are left to do the investigating themselves. For Outlook, Nina Lakhani has been to meet two families whose daughters have gone missing. Richard Musinguzi has been nicknamed the 'Walt Disney of Uganda'. The 24 year old is the creator of a cartoon character called Katoto, whose comical adventures have a big following on social media. Two women - one Israeli and one Palestinian - are running a successful business together in the macho world of shipping and logistics. Rola Srouji is based in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, Anat Shelach is based in Jerusalem - they explain how they get goods across the heavily-policed barrier between Israel and the Palestinian Territories. Alabaster Box is a group from Ghana. They sing a capella, without instruments, and the four of them say they each have an instrument in their belly. They demonstrate their unusual orchestra to Pooneh Ghoddoosi at the Edinburgh Festival. (Picture: The mother and grandmother of missing girl Syama sit in her bedroom. Credit: Nina Lakhani) Show less
