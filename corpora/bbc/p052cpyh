How might robots help us live, work and even love in the future? Jane Wakefield meets robots being used in hospitals factories and even bedrooms and she navigates the way humans are using machines. In California, Jane interviews Harmony, a sex robot who will be for sale at the end of the year. She hears how some people are forming relationships with their artificial intelligence, and asks what an increasing dependence on robotics means for our human interaction. Jane speaks to the creators of Real Doll the sex robots, and to robotic ethicists as well as international expert Noel Sharkey, who argues we need international rules to govern the use of robotics urgently. Can robots be our friends? Jane hears from all sides of the debate. (Photo credit: BBC) Show less
