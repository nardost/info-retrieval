Nujeen Mustafa was born with cerebral palsy, and for most of the first 16 years of her life had barely left her home in the Syrian city of Aleppo. When the war made life there too dangerous, Nujeen had to make the perilous journey to Europe in her wheelchair. Yu Jianchun is a migrant worker who lives in in Hangzhou, China. Despite only having a high school education, he has stunned the maths world with his imaginative solution to a complex maths problem. Kris Hernandez became a professional wrestler when she moved to Japan. It is a world of backflips, body slams and elaborate costumes. She takes part in intricately planned shows in front of huge crowds against international competitors. American writer Adam Haslett was only 14 when his father killed himself. Over 30 years later Adam has written about the experience in his new novel Imagine Me Gone. (Photo: Nujeen Mustafa in her wheelchair) Show less
