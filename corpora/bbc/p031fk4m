Women have proven to be some of the most ruthlessly effective of terrorists. Bridget Kendall investigates their motivation and their impact. From Russia's 19th Century Nihilists to contemporary Sri Lanka and Palestine, women have played central roles in terrorist organisations. Attacks planned or executed by women attract attention and inspire fear in a way that male terrorists can only dream of. Why are we still shocked by female terrorists? Why are they so effective? How can women be dissuaded from joining terrorist organisations? BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall investigates the motives that drive women to kill and considers the response of the media and the public to those who have planted bombs, hijacked planes and killed innocents in their quest for political change.
