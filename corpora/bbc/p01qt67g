Asra Nomani was a friend and colleague of Daniel Pearl. After he was beheaded by militants she was determined to use her skills as a reporter to track down all those involved - she tells Matthew how she came face-to-face with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed who claimed responsibility for the killing. Also, Tracey Curtis-Taylor, the British woman who flew from Cape Town to Cairo in a 1930s bi-plane - with an open cockpit - talks about the inspiration behind her epic journey covering over 9000 miles. Dr Gamal Albinsaid, is a young Indonesian doctor who has come up with an innovative scheme which gives even the poorest people access to a doctor - they pay with rubbish. What motivated him to start the scheme? Plus, American rapper Angel Haze talks about using her music to recover from a difficult childhood. (Photo: Asra Nomani.
