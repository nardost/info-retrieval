Peter White, who was born without sight, tours the world, navigating primarily with his ears. Where most travellers store up visual images of the places they visit, Peter takes his tape recorder and relies on everything except eyes to guide him. Peter's latest spot of tourism takes him to Moscow, a city he describes as "satisfyingly noisy:" Twenty-four hour police sirens, throbbing music from every doorway and some of what he describes as the noisiest metro trains he's ever come across anywhere in the world! From Peter this is not a criticism, he loves public transport, which he says give him the keys to a city.
