Andargachew Tsege was a wanted man. He was a political activist and a long-time critic of the Ethiopian government. For his opposition work, he was tried in absentia and given the death sentence. But Andargachew and his fianc√©e Yemi Hailemariam weren't worried. They lived in the UK with their three children, far away from any political enemies in Ethiopia. But then, in June 2014, Andargachew was abducted at an airport, and Yemi would start a long hard struggle to find him, and bring him home.
