MOHAMMAD MOSTAFAEI Mohammad Mostafaei is the former lawyer of Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani. She's the Iranian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning for allegedly committing adultery. Her case caused an international outcry and the sentence hasn't yet been carried out. Mohammad was responsible for drawing the world's attention to her plight, but was forced to flee from Iran and has now been given asylum in Norway. He tells Matthew Bannister about his childhood and his long campaign against the death penalty in Iran. REINHOLD MESSNER Reinhold Messner is considered one of the world's greatest mountaineers. In 1978, he was part of the first team to climb Mount Everest without oxygen and without the help of sherpas. Two years later he repeated that climb by himself, setting another record. He went on to reach the summits of all the other 13 peaks in the world above 8,000 metres, always climbing without oxygen. Now in his sixties, Reinhold Messner is setting up a series of mountain museums in the Alps. For Outlook, Irene Caselli went to meet him in his native valley in the South Tyrol region of northern Italy. Show less
