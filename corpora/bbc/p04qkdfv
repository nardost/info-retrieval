Claudia Luca was 11 years old when she found out she was born without a womb. She grew up knowing she would never be able to have children. But then her mother, Antonietta, offered to help, and at the age of 53, became her daughter's surrogate and ended up giving birth to her grandson. Manoj Bhavsar - the Indian man protecting people from lethal kite strings in Ahmedabad. Ma Baoli - the Chinese policeman leading a double life. By day he was pretending to be straight, but by night he set up a website that would become China's biggest gay dating app. Sister Monica and Siervas - a Peruvian-based rock'n'roll band comprised entirely of nuns. The nuns come from across the globe and, as Outlook's Jane Chambers discovered, their hits have earned them fans all the way to the top of the Catholic Church.
