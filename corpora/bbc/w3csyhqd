For years, former US doctor Larry Nassar abused hundreds of young girls and women. As the official doctor attached to elite gymnastics teams, he used his position to conduct sexually exploitative and medically unwarranted examinations - using physical therapy as a cover. He managed to persuade hundreds of people - including police officers - that what he was doing was legitimate. Eventually, many top athletes spoke about the abuse, including World and Olympic Champion Gymnast Simone Biles. One of those women is Rachel Haines, although for a long time she was known only as 'Survivor 195'. She recently decided to reveal her name and she has written a book about her experience, Abused.
