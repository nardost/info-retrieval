In 2012, the celebrated war correspondent Marie Colvin was killed by Syrian government shelling in the city of Homs. Her sister Cat Colvin believed Marie had been deliberately targeted, in an effort to silence her reporting. Cat would begin a long campaign for justice, one which would eventually lead to a landmark court ruling. Heba is a young Iraqi woman living in Baghdad, but her heart belongs in South Korea. By her own admission, she is obsessed. And she's not alone. In fact, there's a whole group of people in Baghdad who adore Korean culture, and who get together in person and online to share their love of Korean music and videos. They call themselves the Iraq Korea Sarangbang. The clip from the Korea TV drama is from the Left-handed wife, which was directed by Kim Myeong-Mook and produced by Pan Entertainment. Sergeant Simphiwe Mgwetana, known as Charlie, is a police officer walking the beat in a township called Kayamandi, just outside Stellenbosch in South Africa. Kayamandi has troubles, especially with petty crime, and Charlie got so tired of arresting the same people over and over, that he came up with an innovative plan, to start his own football team. He invited our reporter Mohammed Allie into his police car to give him a tour of the township. (Image: Cat and Marie Colvin. Photo credit: Tara Gadomski.) Show less
