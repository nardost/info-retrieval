Pen Farthing was a British Royal Marine when he turned his attention to animal welfare. He told Matthew Bannister about the dog that changed his outlook. Pili Hussein disguised herself as a man so that she could work down a mine in Tanzania. It was only after she was accused of rape that her secret came out and she cleared her name. 19-year-old Fatim Jawara grew up in The Gambia, and played for her the national women's team. She set her sights on playing in Europe and attempted to cross the Mediterranean in a dinghy. She didn't make it. Reporter Irene Caselli has been hearing her story. Below street level in New York City, cellist Kei Otake plays to commuters on the subway. He has a rare condition that means he finds it hard to communicate - but once he picks up his bow, passers-by can hear his musical message loud and clear. Colm Flynn went to meet him.
