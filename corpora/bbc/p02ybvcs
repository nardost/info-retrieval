Award-winning South African film makers Dereck and Beverly Joubert have spent years battling scorpions and swamps in order to track and film wildlife in the Botswana bush. They've also made it their life's work to save Africa's lions with their project The Big Cat Initiative. Abhina Aher was born a boy biologically and is now a 'hijra', a member of the transgender community in India - now officially recognised as a third gender. She talks about how it took her family a long time to come to terms with her change of identity: Claudia Rankine, Jamaican-born poet talks about her latest book Citizen which tackles the subject of race relations in America. It's 20 years since the worst mass killing on European soil since World War Two. Around 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed by Serb forces near the town of Srebrenica in Bosnia in July 1995. This year, 10,000 people marked the anniversary with a three-day march, retracing the footsteps of the men as they fled over the hills to reach safety. The March of Peace recreates the 120-km journey in reverse: from Nezuk in northern Bosnia, towards Srebrenica. Our reporter Jo Impey went along. And, the adventures of an Italian base jumper - Uli Emanuele travels the world in a wingsuit, jumping from buildings and mountains before landing with a parachute. His latest video shows a heart-stopping stunt in which he leaps from the top of a mountain in Switzerland and falls at high speed through a two and a half metre gap in an outcrop of rock. Obviously you shouldn't try this yourself! Picture credit: Wildfire Films Show less
