Sarah Shourd, Shane Bauer and Joshua Fattal made headline news in the summer of 2009, when they were imprisoned in Iran and accused of spying - a charge they have always denied. They were hiking in the mountains of Kurdish northern Iraq when they crossed the Iranian border. They were immediately arrested, and ended up in Tehran's notorious Evin prison. Sarah was released after a year because of her health. The two men were kept in jail for a second year, at the end of which they were tried and convicted of espionage and illegal entry, but freed a few weeks later. Two and a half years on, the three have written a book about their experiences called A Sliver of Light. Twins Ann and Elizabeth Lamb were born in the English town of Aldershot in the 1930s to an unmarried mother, who could not look after both of them. She kept Elizabeth with her, but put five-month-old Ann up for adoption. Ann was never told she had a twin and found out only recently, at the age of 77. The two of them finally spoke to each other in April last year and next week they will meet, face-to-face, in Los Angeles. Elizabeth now lives in Oregon. Ahead of that meeting, Jo Fidgen speaks to them both. American Savion Glover is considered by many to be one of the world's top tap dancer. Born in New Jersey, America he was only 10 when he starred in The Tap Dance Kid on Broadway. He is known as the choreographer behind Mumble the penguin of the 2006 animation film Happy Feet.
