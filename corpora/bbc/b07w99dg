In a special edition of Start the Week Andrew Marr is at the Bluecoat Gallery in Liverpool. He's joined by the writer Phil Redmond, historian John Belchem and journalists Gary Younge and Kajsa Norman to discuss historical myth-making, segregation and assimilation - from Liverpool's radical past, to the US and its obsession with guns and race, to the Transvaal and the survival tactics of the Afrikaner community. With the Labour party conference in full swing in Liverpool Andrew Marr will also be discussing how far people will go to retain their cultural identity and what happens when splits appear.
