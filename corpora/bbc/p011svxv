When Teddy Olang stood for election as an MP in Kenya in 2007 she was branded a traitor by her community because of the party she stood for. Her house was burned down and she was forced into hiding. But she hasn't let the experience put her off politics and says she's determined to stand again in the elections which take place next March. And an Arab American who served with the US marines during the Iraq war describes his mixed emotions on the front line.
