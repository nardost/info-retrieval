CITIES AND MEMORY Last week Laurie Taylor visited Berlin to discover how the city is dealing with the ghosts of its past. But other cities around the world have also carved the memories of their citizens into their buildings and infrastructure. As communities change, new memories become layered over old ones, and decisions about what is commemorated and what is forgotten come to reflect the prevailing political climate of the day. Laurie is joined by the writer and filmmaker Iain Sinclair, Professor Richard Sennett and Professor Sophie Watson to discuss how cities come to reflect the pride, and the shame, of what has gone before.
