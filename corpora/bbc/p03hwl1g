How are dating apps changing the way people find love around the world? In New York, it's been called the dating apocalypse. The birth of the dating app has left people with so many options, they can't - or don't want to - settle on just one. In Delhi, young people can be disowned or worse by their families if they refuse to marry someone of their parents' choosing. But a growing number of urbanites are now using apps to flirt with the distinctly un-Indian concept of dating. In Nairobi, where gay sex can get you a 14-year prison sentence, apps are allowing men to meet other men away from public places. But the anonymity that brings a sense of security can also bring danger. In Modern Love, Simon Maybin spends time with daters in all three cities, trying to understand how this new technology is changing the way people find romance across the world. Show less
