Fi Glover introduces seven conversations recorded in Beirut between refugees who have fled the war in Syria to make a new life for themselves in Lebanon or elsewhere. All the conversations except one, were recorded in Arabic and have been translated into English, the words spoken by actors Sirine Saba, Paul Chahidi, Suzanna Nour, Mariam Haque, Nadia Albina, Farshid Rokey and Evie Killip. Conor Garrett, of BBC Radio Ulster, recorded the conversations which were sourced and facilitated by Oxfam in Beirut. (Photo: Ahmad (L) and Safa) Show less
