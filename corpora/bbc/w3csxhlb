The opioid epidemic in America is hurting all levels of society. In Louisville, Kentucky, drug overdose related deaths are twice the national average. What will the impact be on the next generation? We hear of babies born addicted as a result of their mothersâ€™ drug use, an inspiring school choir and the families finding ways to face up to the epidemic. A mother is campaigning to hold pharmaceutical companies to account and citizens, faith groups and politicians are responding to the crisis.
