Title: Oliver North's jury
Link: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0441ww8
Last Broadcast Date: Sun 7 May 1989
As the North verdict is delivered, is it time to question the way in which juries are selected - before a 'mistrial' plea goes in? This archive edition of Letter from America was recorded by one of two listeners, who between them taped and labelled over 650 Letter From America programmes from 1973 to 1989. It was restored by the BBC in 2014. Show less
