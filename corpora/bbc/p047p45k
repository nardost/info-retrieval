Katty Kay reports from Washington on the much anticipated face-to-face encounter between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the crucial first Presidential Debate on 26 September. Clinton’s dilemma - how to prepare to debate with a seasoned TV performer who favours “off the cuff” remarks and personal attacks. Who might play the part of 'The Donald' in the mock debates that Clinton is undertaking in preparation for the real thing. And, will Trump do any preparation at all? Can he depend on his TV experience to connect with the audience, or will he risk slipping up against a better briefed opponent? Katty Kay has covered US presidential election campaigns and debates since 2004. She explores the business of preparing candidates for their make-or-break one-on-one confrontations. She considers how this year’s debates may differ from previous campaigns and whether the debates could decide who will be elected president in November. We hear about what debate preparation entails, from advisers and strategists who have taken part in previous debate preparation. We hear from those covering the current campaign explain the challenges Hillary Clinton faces in preparing to debate with Donald Trump. Katty looks back at how the role of debate preparation has changed over the years, from the very first presidential debate in 1960, through to Carter, Reagan, Bush and Obama to see what lessons there may be for the two candidates taking part in 2016.
