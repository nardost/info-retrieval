The beaches of California provide the 'canvas' for artist Andres Amador, who rakes giant patterns into the sand only for them to be washed away. Matthew joins him on the beach. Health workers trying to vaccinate children against polio in Pakistan have repeatedly been targeted by militants and since 2012 over 40 people have been killed because of their links to the vaccination programme. We speak to one young woman who puts her own life at risk to carry out her work. Maurillia Simpson from Trinidad carried out three duty tours of duty in Iraq with the British army. But a serious leg injury forced her to leave her dream job. She is now acting in a stage play called The Two Worlds of Charlie F, along with other former soldiers. She tells Nicky Paxman about the hilarious process of rehearsing for the play. James Wannerton is President of the UK Synaesthesia Association - and he has an unusual form of the condition in which his senses for taste and sound are mixed up. Find out what Matthew's name tastes like to him! Show less
