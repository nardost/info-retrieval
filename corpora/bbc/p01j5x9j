The dramatic, disturbing and inspiring story of Malala Yousafzai has drawn the attention of the world. Now, she talks about her life in her own words, in an exclusive interview with Mishal Husain. Malala was an ordinary schoolgirl from Pakistanâ€™s Swat Valley who achieved prominence by blogging for the BBC during the Taliban takeover of her home region. She wrote about how the Taliban had banned her and other girls in Swat from attending school. After the Taliban were forced out, she became an internationally known campaigner for the right of all girls to an education. In October 2012, the Taliban took revenge, sending a gunman to kill her. He shot her in the head and shoulder, leaving her on the point of death. There was a massive wave of sympathy and support from across the globe and Malala was airlifted to the English city of Birmingham for medical treatment. This will be her first full interview since the attack, in which she will talk about her life, her fight and her dreams. Picture: Malala Yousafzai, Credit: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images Show less
