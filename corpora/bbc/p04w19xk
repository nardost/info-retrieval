The media in the United States is broken. Most journalists and media organisations dismissed the possibility of Trump Presidency. Many backed Hillary Clinton to win. It has left them in a precarious position with serious questions about their credibility, fuelled by the president and his inner circle, who have branded them ‘enemies of the state’. Kyle Pope, editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, asks how the media should respond to a hostile administration, and more importantly how can the media gain the trust of the vast numbers of people who think it is hopelessly biased.
