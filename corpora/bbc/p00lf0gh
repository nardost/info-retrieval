Noah Richler traces the development of storytelling from the earliest creation myths through to today's online gaming and the recording of our personal lives by way of social media. The second programme looks at how creation myths and epics in the 21st Century continue to be part of our experience of storytelling, and that through computer games and social media people assume different identities â€“ hero, villain, warrior, and peacemaker. The series ends with the thought that perhaps we humans are the servant of the story, the vessel through which story lives, and it's the survival of 'story' that is paramount. Show less
