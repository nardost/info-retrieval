This BBC World Service series has been tracking the lives of East Londoners living on a deprived housing estate, in the shadow of the 2012 Olympic Park for the past two years. The BBC's Nina Robinson reports. Episode 4: Inspiring a Real Legacy "Although we live very close to it, we don't feel part of it at all," so says single mum Hillary Wilgress. "Because people are people, they're not thinking this is great because this is going to help us with the Olympics. They're thinking what a pain it is… stuck in traffic again." Organisers argue that the legacy of the Games will be felt for generations to come. Aside from the Olympic Village itself – which residents admit is impressive - there will be new commercial areas, a library, homes, better infrastructure and a shopping centre. With the prospects for jobs, will regeneration affect those who need it most? First broadcast on 20 October 2010. (Image: A visit to the Olympic site. Credit: Associated Press) Show less
