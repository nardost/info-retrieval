On Outlook today with Matthew Bannister... Surviving Niagara Falls - the remarkable story of Roger Woodward and his sister Deanne. In a special edition of the programme, we return to the remarkable story of Roger Woodward, who as a seven year old boy - was swept over the Niagara Falls and lived to tell the tale. It is now fifty years since the accident, but, for Roger, the events of that day remain as clear as ever. He tells Matthew what was going through his mind as he went over the Falls, but he also talks about the extraordinary rescue of his sister Deanne who was helped by a man called John Hayes. Deanne was to tell Roger many years later that it was the power of John's voice that kept her from giving up. Hear their extraordinary story on Outlook. Show less
