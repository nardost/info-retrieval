Alison Cope's teenage son, Joshua Ribera - Depzman to his friends - was a rising star on the grime music scene. Grime is a type of rap music that's very big in Birmingham, in the English Midlands, where Joshua was from. He put out his debut album in July 2013, just before his 18th birthday, and he had a number one hit on iTunes. A few weeks later, he was dead. Alison was devastated but she didn't predict the impact his death would have on his fans. Her response to their pain was extraordinary and has won her a place among our incredible Outlook Inspirations nominees. Caracals are a stunning looking wild cat. They live in various places around the world, but you won't often see one. They usually stay out of humans' way, which is a problem for Dr Laurel Serieys, a Texas-born ecologist who works in Cape Town, and who tries to track them down to study them. When Paul Fronczak discovered some old newspaper clippings in his childhood home, he realised he was not who he thought he was. He set off to discover his true identity. It was a journey that would throw up unimaginable surprises. Image: Alison Cope Credit: BBC Show less
