JESSICA STERN Dr Jessica Stern was once named by Time Magazine as one of seven thinkers whose innovative ideas would "change the world". She studies people who commit acts of terrorism, and flies around the globe interviewing violent extremists. The Pentagon and the CIA have turned to her for advice. She now lectures in terrorism at Harvard University. But Jessica says she didn't understand what was driving her until police reopened their investigation into the rape she suffered as a 15 year old. She wanted to discover his identity - and in doing so, rediscovered herself. VINOD THAKUR Vinod Thakur is a hip hop dancer with a difference - he was born without legs. The 21-year-old is from a poor part of Delhi, and has been impressing television audiences with his skills on the hit show India's Got Talent. Sadly he is now out of the competition, but the channel hosting the contest has now asked him to perform abroad. Vinod spoke to Outlook's Jo Fidgen about achieving his dreams.
