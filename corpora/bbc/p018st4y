Matthew Bannister talks to Mamphela Ramphele, the anti-apartheid activist & Steve Biko's partner. She was South Africa's first black University Vice Chancellor; she was a director at the World Bank; and now she's started her own political party. We also hear from the Georgian pianist Alexander Toradze, who defected to the West 30 years ago. And we have an interview with Tawakul Karman from Yemen, who's the first Arab woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
