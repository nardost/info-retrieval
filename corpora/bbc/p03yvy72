Ibrahim al-Hussein is a Syrian swimmer who lost part of his leg to a bomb. He now hopes to compete at the Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro. Costume designer Peter Minshall has, for over 30 years, designed and choreographed dozens of vividly flamboyant productions for the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival. He has just returned after a 10-year break. Texas Mwimba is the Democratic Republic of the Congo's first albino wrestler. He is out to challenge preconceptions about his condition. When American author Nathanael Johnson moved to San Francisco from the countryside, he was sad that his young daughter would not experience nature the way he had growing up. But as she grew older she surprised him with the way she saw nature in the city. He has now written a book encouraging others to become amateur urban naturalists.
