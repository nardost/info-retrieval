NATASCHA KAMPUSCH: Natascha Kampusch was just ten years old on March 2nd 1998 when she was snatched off the street by a mentally disturbed man in his mid 30s. She didn't escape until she was 18. Her kidnapper, Wolfgang Priklopil, committed suicide a week later. Now, four years on, Natascha has written her story in a book entitled 3096 Days. FRENCH CASTLE: In the Northern Burgundy village of Treigny, Maryline Martin is undertaking an extraordinary project. She and her team are building a medieval castle from scratch.

That means using no modern construction methods whatsoever. Show less
