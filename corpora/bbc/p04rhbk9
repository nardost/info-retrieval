Mohammad Sayed is a disabled teenager from Afghanistan who was abandoned by his family and spent his childhood living in a hospital. Now he's been adopted by an American family and has designed a comic super hero called Wheelchair Man, based on his own life story. We also travel to France to meet beekeeper Audric de Campeau, who keeps his bees on top of some of the most famous landmarks in Paris. Benjamin Patton is the grandson of the legendary US war hero General Patton. He is a documentary film maker from New York who is giving veterans the chance to make a short film about their experience of the battlefield. Andrew Faris became homeless after his business collapsed. He has now got back on his feet and founded his own charity in London - a caf√© where he helps other homeless people to get off the streets.
