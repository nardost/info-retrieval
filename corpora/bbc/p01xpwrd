Lucy Ash talks to three generations of the Kupny family who have all worked at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. American Savion Glover is considered by many to be one of the world's top tap dancer. Born in New Jersey, America he was only 10 when he starred in The Tap Dance Kid on Broadway. He's known as the choreographer of Mumble the penguin of the 2006 animation film Happy Feet. Romulo Emiliani is the Roman Catholic bishop of San Pedro Sula, a city in northern Honduras recently described as 'the most violent city on Earth'. Last year, the Bishop made the news after he helped broker a truce between two of the country's most notorious street gangs. Sarah Shourd, Shane Bauer and Joshua Fattal made headline news in the summer of 2009, when they were imprisoned in Iran and accused of spying - a charge they have always denied. They were hiking in the mountains of Kurdish northern Iraq when they crossed the Iranian border. They were immediately arrested, and ended up in Tehran's notorious Evin prison. Sarah was released after a year because of her health. The two men were kept in jail for a second year, at the end of which they were tried and convicted of espionage and illegal entry, but freed a few weeks later. Two and a half years on, the three have written a book about their experiences called A Sliver of Light. In May 1913, a young German man named Richard Platz cast a beer bottle containing a postcard into the Baltic Sea. In March this year, a fisherman found the bottle in his net and handed it to the International Maritime Museum in Hamburg. Now researchers have tracked down Richard's nearest living descendent - his granddaughter Angela Erdmann, who lives in Berlin. Show less
