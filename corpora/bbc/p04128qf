Nura Aabe is from Somalia but grew up in the English city of Bristol. When her son, Zak, was diagnosed with autism as a toddler- she found she had little support from those around her and became isolated from the community. She decided to set up her own organisation to help other women in her situation. Tim Doucette spent the first year of his life blind. However, an operation as a teenager meant he could see stars and planets in a way a person with full vision could not. Still legally blind, Tim set up an observatory near his home in Nova Scotia in Canada and now runs a stargazing business. (Picture: Reginald Dwayne Betts. Credit: Rachel Eliza Griffiths.) Show less
