In 2015, the US airforce bombed what they thought was a Taliban compound in the Afghan city of Kunduz. It was, in fact, a hospital, run by Médecins Sans Frontières. We hear from Andrew Quilty, the first journalist to arrive on the scene, who found a man dead on an operating table. Haunted by the image, Andrew made it his mission to trace the man's family and find out more about his life. Steven Spielberg is one of the world's most successful film directors. For his latest film, Bridge Of Spies, he was inspired by his own childhood growing up under the shadow of the Cold War. What's it like when a moment of your life is printed on the front page of every newspaper? That's what happened to Waneek Horn-Miller who comes from the First Nation Mohawk people.

They wanted to stop a golf course expanding onto their traditional land, when the situation spiralled out of control. Sarah Howe is a prize winning poet. She was only seven when her family moved from Hong Kong to England.
