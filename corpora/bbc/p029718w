Alaa Murabit is a young Libyan doctor who leads The Voice of Libyan Women, an organisation which has been campaigning for women's rights since the 2011 uprising. Alaa lives in Zawiya, 40km from the capital, Tripoli. Laurel Braitman had always wanted a Bernese Mountain Dog. So when a breeder got in touch to say that he had an adult dog in need of a home, she was thrilled. But it soon became clear that the dog was deeply disturbed and he brought havoc into Laurel's life. Her experiences started her on a journey around the world to research mental health problems in animals. Her findings are included in a new book called "Animal Madness". Leon Fleisher is an American pianist, once described as "the pianistic find of the century". Until his mid-30s he enjoyed a high-profile concert career. But then the fingers on his right hand started to cramp and curl under. Leon was forced to make a new career for himself as a conductor, teacher and also champion of left-handed piano music. Now aged 86, his latest album All the Things You Are - mostly played only by his left hand - has recently been number one in the American classical music charts. (Picture: Alaa Murabit) Show less
