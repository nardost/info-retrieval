Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, was taken over by militants from Islamic State a year ago. Thousands of people fled - and still can't go home. We hear from two former residents of Mosul - a woman who now works in a hotel in Kurdistan, and a man who is a pilot in the Iraqi air force and now wants to bomb his own home. Anne-Marie Eklund-Lowinder is one of the 14 people in the world who holds a key to the internet. These keys control a system called DNS Sec, that ensures the security of around 50% of webpages. Anne-Marie is a computer security expert from Sweden - and she tells Jo Fidgen how she came to be chosen as a crypto-officer. Twenty nine year old Ziad Sankari from Lebanon has invented a device that President Obama says will save lives all around the world. The Life Sense is a wearable heart monitor that detects the early stages of a heart attack and then calls a hospital to get help before the patient has even realised they are in danger. Heart disease is the world's number one killer and last month Ziad was honoured at the White House. Aisha Zia is a playwright, who was born in Pakistan and brought up in the UK. Her latest play No Guts, No Heart, No Glory, is set in a boxing gym, and uses non-professional actors to tell the story of five young British Muslim women. (Photo: Silhouette of woman and child.
