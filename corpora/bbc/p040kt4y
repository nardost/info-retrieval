In the midst of the Syrian war, Dr Hatem is a paediatrician working in the rebel-held part of the city of Aleppo. He describes a trip he made to Turkey in April that had agonising repercussions. Harekala Hajabba from India didn't have an education himself - but he's making sure that the next generation in his village gets one. Harekala started by putting aside savings from selling oranges in the city of Mangalore, to start a school in his village. 'Embrace of the Serpent' also became the first Colombian film to be nominated for an Oscar and it was the first feature film in the Amazon rainforest for thirty years. The film's director, Ciro Guerra, tells the BBC's Francine Stock about the experience. In Pakistan's tribal areas, women's voices are rarely heard in public life. But Khalida Niaz is one of the best known newsreaders on the region's local radio station. For many listeners, Khalida and her team are the only source of information in a vast, often inaccessible, and very conservative corner of north-western Pakistan.
