This BBC World Service series has been tracking the lives of East Londoners living on a deprived housing estate, in the shadow of the 2012 Olympic Park for the past two years. The BBC's Nina Robinson reports. Episode 2: Dramatic Changes Hilary Wilgress has two children. She does not feel initiatives from the government really work for families like theirs. Nina meets up again with Darrell James, who shows her the new investment at the nearby Dalston Junction train station. Darrell says the change here is dramatic, more so than the development happening in the heart of the estate. And we hear from local politicians and decision makers about the 'legacy' plan - what will happen when the Games are over?
