What is the future of car-making? And for that matter, the future of industrial-scale manufacturing? Is it Industry 4.0 where every component has an IP address? Is it 3D printing? Biomass-derived bodywork materials? Or are incremental improvements, such as increased process and data integration and collaboration the keys to our manufacturing future? Jack Stewart and guests Adrian Price from Ford, Christine Furstoss from GE, Justin Fishkin from Local Motors and Josh Linkner a Detroit based tech entrepreneur explore how we might make things more efficiently and what that means for manufacturing around the World.
