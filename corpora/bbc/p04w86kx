Italian Rita Borsellino's brother was a top anti-mafia judge in Sicily. When he was murdered by the group, she quit her job as a pharmacist and continued his work. Oscar Ekponimo grew up with very little food in Nigeria. He then became a software engineer and has invented an app that aims to end food waste by connecting retailers with charities who distribute provisions to the hungry. Last year a 27-year-old Canadian called Robert Gagno won the World Pinball Championship. Robert has autism so taking part in the sport has been a way of building an independent life.
