On Last Word this week: Juan Antonio Samaranch - President of the International Olympic Committee who was credited with transforming the fortunes of the modern Olympics, but dogged by allegations of corruption and the use of drugs in sport. The actor, director and writer Tom Fleming who was also the voice of major royal occasions on the BBC. His professionalism guided us through events like the Queens's Coronation, the wedding and funeral of Princess Diana and the Edinburgh Tattoo. Ronald Gregory who was the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire police at the time of the much criticised investigation into the Yorkshire Ripper murders. And Bishop Abel Muzorewa who tried to negotiate a peaceful transition to black majority rule in Rhodesia before being trounced at the polls by Robert Mugabe. Show less
