John Simpson joins Philip Dodd to discuss fifty years of reporting from around the world for the BBC and what the future holds for foreign correspondents. Once our news came from three primary sources: newspapers, radio and TV. But in a digital world which offers a proliferation of 'news' how do we separate fact from opinion or even fakery? Former director general of the BBC and current CEO of The New York Times Company, Mark Thompson, journalist Susie Boniface (aka Fleet Street Fox), author and TV producer, Peter Pomerantsev, and academic, Martin Moore, consider what we mean by news in 2016. We Chose to Speak of War and Strife: The World of the Foreign Correspondent is by John Simpson. Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia is by Peter Pomerantsev Enough Said: What's gone wrong with the language of politics? is by Mark Thompson.
