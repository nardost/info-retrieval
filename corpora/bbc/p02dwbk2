When Claudio de Oliveira was born his mother was advised not to feed him as doctors believed he would not survive. Claudio had a rare condition called arthrogryposis which causes bones to fuse, and meant his head was upside down on his back. Today Claudio is 38, and has gone on to get a degree in accountancy and has a burgeoning career as a public speaker in Brazil and beyond. When Ashleigh Bryant served with the US marines in Afghanistan in 2009 she was a military journalist reporting on the conflict for the American Department of Defense. It was only when she returned home that the full horror of what she had witnessed in Afghanistan began to affect every aspect of her life. Siphokazi Mdlankomo is a domestic worker from Cape Town in South Africa with a passion for cooking.

Booker shortlisted writer M J Hyland was diagnosed with MS in 2008 whilst writing her third novel This Is How. The diagnosis seriously impacted her ability to write. However, the resilience that enabled her to overcome an abusive and troubled childhood, also gave her the strength to continue writing and teaching and to finally 'come out' as an MS sufferer, thereby helping others come to terms with the illness.
