MAHMOUD KABIL Mahmoud Kabil is famous in Egypt for his award-winning film roles and humanitarian work as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF across the Middle East and North Africa. But since the protests in the country began last week, his work has been much closer to home than usual. He's been helping to protect his community from the criminals who have been trying to take advantage of the chaos by looting homes and businesses. JASMIN DARZNIK Jasmin Darznik was born in Iran, but moved with her parents to the United States at the age of five.
