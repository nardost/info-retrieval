Cecil Rajendra has won a lifetime achievement award in Malaysia for his achievement in making the justice system available to everyone, even if they can't afford to pay lawyers. Somehow in his spare moments he's written Nobel-nominated poetry. He spoke to Jo Fidgen Outlook hears from the winners of the Queen's Commonwealth Essay Competition, which has been celebrating young creative talent for more than 100 years. Four young women, aged 12 to 17, are heading to Buckingham Palace to receive their awards, but first they came to our studio to chat to Outlook's Deiniol Buxton. The event has been organised by the Royal Commonwealth Society. Picture: Lawyer and poet Cecil Rajendra Credit: Cecil Rajendra Show less
