Matthew Bannister on: Dame Barbara Mills QC, the successful barrister who became the first woman Director of Public Prosecutions. The poet and singer Gil Scott-Heron who gave voice to the black American experience. The surrealist artist Leonora Carrington who scandalised her father by running away with Max Ernst and became a national treasure in Mexico.
