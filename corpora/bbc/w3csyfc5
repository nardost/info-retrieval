When British soldier Lee Rigby was murdered by extremists on the streets of London, the impact on his mum, Lyn, was devastating. But in her darkest hour help came from an unusual source, a 1970s wrestling star known as Kendo Nagasaki. They tell Outlook's Emily Webb how they started working together. Aeham Ahmad grew up in Yarmouk refugee camp in the suburbs of Damascus in Syria. Nowadays, he's known as the 'Pianist of Yarmouk' after staging an iconic performance during the Syrian conflict. Beth Moon is a fine art photographer who has made it her mission to capture some of the worldâ€™s biggest and oldest trees. Her research found that there might be a link between tree size and starlight. So Beth went on a journey to photograph enormous trees in remote parts of Africa, which sat under skies glittering with stars. (Image: Peter Thornley aka Kendo Nagasaki with Lyn Rigby.
