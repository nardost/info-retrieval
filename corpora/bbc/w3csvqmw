Marina Jose is an Indian nurse who has worked in different parts of the world. In 2014 she was part of a group of nurses held hostage for 23 days by militants from so-called Islamic State. It happened when they were working at Tikrit hospital in Northern Iraq. She told Matthew Bannister how they survived. Among the bespoke tailors who make expensive suits in London's famous Savile Row, Andrew Ramroop stands out. He started his career in a tailor's shop in his birth country - the Caribbean island of Trinidad and Tobago. But he always dreamed of getting to Savile Row. He tells us about his extraordinary journey from rural Trinidad to the heart of London's West End. Savannah Heuser from South Africa was just sixteen years old when she opened a sanctuary for big cats. She lives on her family's extensive farm in Limpopo province and was allowed to use some of the land to create the Emoya big cat sanctuary - offering a safe space to lions and tigers which had been rescued from circuses and zoos. She tells Matthew Bannister how a trip with her Mum when she was fourteen, inspired her to take her interest to the next level. Many people enjoy projects like rebuilding an old car or motorbike, designing their own treehouse or even building a boat, but Cameron Smith from Portland, Oregon in the USA has gone one step further. He's built his own space suit. He tells us why. Image: View of Tikrit March 2015 Credit: AHMAD AL-RUBAYE/Getty Images Show less
