John Aldridge goes lobster fishing off the New York coast. One night in 2013 he fell overboard into the Atlantic Ocean and it was hours before his friend and crewmate, Anthony Sosinski, realised he was missing. They tell Outlook about the frantic search and rescue and the incredible story of survival. Georgie Imberger gives free piano lessons to migrant children who have just arrived in Australia and are trying to settle in to their new life. Joel Carnegie goes to meet Georgie and hear her young students perform. The Razzouk family have been tattooing pilgrims in Jerusalem for 500 years; they claim to have introduced the first electric tattoo gun to Israel. Outlook's Yolande Knell heads to the tattoo parlour to meet Wassim Razzouk. Kevin Beresford shares his love of roundabouts. He's the founder of the UK Roundabout Appreciation Society and his passion for circular intersections with an island in the middle is infectious. (Picture: John Aldridge and Anthony Soskinski.
