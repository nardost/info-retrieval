Kim Hughes is the British Army's most highly decorated bomb disposal expert. In 2009 the greatest threat to British soldiers in Afghanistan was IEDs - Improvised Explosive Devices, which killed and injured thousands of troops and civilians. Kim was awarded the George Cross after defusing an unprecedented 119 bombs in just 6 months in Afghanistan. For thousands of years, children the world over have entertained themselves by standing inside a ring of willow, vines, grasses - or these days usually plastic - and twirling it around their waists. It's come to be known as a hula-hoop and Marawa Ibrahim takes it slightly more seriously than most. She's from Australia and has set up a world record breaking troupe of hula-hoopers in London called Marawa's Majorettes. They perform all round the globe and Outlook's Emily Webb went to a rehearsal to meet them. If you are a fan of techno music, the name Richie Hawtin will mean a lot to you. Also known as Plastikman, he's a really big deal in the business as a DJ, label owner and promoter. He cut his DJ-ing teeth in Detroit, the birthplace of techno, in the early '90s, but lived across the bridge in Canada, where he'd landed at the age of nine, fresh from England.
