The moon has fascinated humans everywhere and for all time. Why? Mike Williams explores the moon in culture, how it affects life on Earth and he asks Alan Bean – one of the handful of people who have walked on it – what the moon is really like. Produced by Richard Knight Image shows a full moon as seen from the sky at night. Credit: AFP/Getty Images Show less
