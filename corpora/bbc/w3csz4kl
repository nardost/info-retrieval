Think of Denmark and we think of a country with a high standard of living and of ‘hygge’: cosy living, wellbeing, and long evenings spent with friends. In this edition of World Book Café, Lawrence Pollard meets a panel of authors to find out if the reality matches the reputation as they share their experiences of living and writing in the Danish capital. He’s joined on stage by Dorthe Nors, Olga Ravn, Jonas T Bengtsson and Caroline Albertine Minor, in front of a lively audience, to debunk some of the myths around hygge, and to talk about the role of writers in Danish society, about the challenge of encouraging diverse voices in the publishing industry and the hidden locations in Copenhagen that inspire their work.
