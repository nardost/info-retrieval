Nadine Shah a British Muslim artist travels to Beirut, to collaborate with Lebanese singer-songwriter and musicologist Youmna Saba. The challenge will be for them to create a track together in Beirut in just two days. Both have very different musical styles and cultural heritages. Nadine was born in Whitburn, South Tyneside, to an English mother of part-Norwegian ancestry and a Pakistani father. Her music is very much inspired by conflict, immigration, and cultural and religious identity, and her latest album Holiday Destination was written about the Syrian refugee crisis. This is her first visit to the Middle East. Youmna Saba holds a masterâ€™s degree in Musicology, focusing mainly on the parallels between classical Arabic music and Arabic visual art. She is a part-time instructor at the musicology department at the Antonine University. Her sound borrows elements from the Arabic music tradition, and blends them with electronic treatments, sonic textures and loops. (Photo: Nadine Shah (R) and (L) Youmna Saba) Show less
