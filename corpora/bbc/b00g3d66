DETECTIVES Laurie Taylor brings past and present together to explore the culture of the detective. He talks to criminologists Louise Westmarland and Dick Hobbs and Kate Summerscale, author of The Suspicions of Mr Whicher; or, The Murder at Road Hill House. They discuss the theory and practice of detection based on Kateâ€™s book, a gripping story of a real-life 19th century murder as well as a sociological treatise on the nature and significance of the detective in fact and fiction.
