Mike Williams finds out how the way we lend and borrow money is changing. He travels to Blackpool to meet 71-year-old Jeannette, whose life was ruined by debt. He speaks to David Graeber, author of Debt: The First 5000 Years, and learns about a ground breaking debt collection service that finds people jobs before asking for their money.
