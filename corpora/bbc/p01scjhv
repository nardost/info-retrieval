During the civil war in El Salvador soldiers forced Josefina Flores to give up her three-year-old daughter Xiomara on pain of death. She thought she would never see her again - but a few months ago they were reunited. Mother and daughter tell Matthew Bannister what it is like to be together again after so long apart. Tetiana Chornovol is a Ukrainian anti-government activist and investigative reporter who has built a reputation for unusual stunts. But her work exposing corruption has come at a price. She explains how she was brutally attacked last year after her car was forced off the road. Monique Pool from Suriname talks about opening her home to scores of three-toed sloths when the forest was being felled nearby. And, born with a rare form of dwarfism, American Tiffanie DiDonato explains why she chose to have controversial and risky surgery to increase her height.
