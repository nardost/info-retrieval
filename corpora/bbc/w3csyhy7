At the age of 16 Amina was happy and in love with a local boy in Jordan. She dreamt of their wedding and future together. But then she discovered a secret about her sister, which brought 'shame' on her family and her father went to violent extremes to protect his family's so-called honour. Emily Webb hears this harrowing story through Amina's words and Norwegian journalist Lene Wold, who spent time with her to write a book called 'Inside an Honour Killing.'
