Pussy Riot first came to the world's attention in early 2012 when three of their members, including Maria Alyokhina, were arrested in Moscow for performing a protest song at a cathedral near the Kremlin. Maria, and one other member, were convicted of "hooliganism motivated by religious hatred" and spent nearly two years in a penal colony in Siberia. She tells Outlook about her experience in prison, the protests and how she took her prison guards to court and won. When Hurricane Harvey struck Texas, a mother in Missouri decided she had to do something to help. So Danielle Palmer sent thirty litres of her own breast milk to mothers in the devastated area. But why did she have so much milk to give? It all began when she discovered she was pregnant with her third son Truett. A few years ago, American Professor Daniel Mendelsohn was teaching a seminar on Homer's Odyssey. Sitting in his class that day was an unusual student, his father. The epic book tells the extraordinary adventures of the Greek hero Odysseus and inspired Daniel and his father to set out on their own adventures. He's written a book about it called "An Odyssey. A father, a son, an epic". Image: Maria Alekhina from Pussy Riot Credit: n/a Show less
