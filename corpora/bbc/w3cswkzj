When Bobby Shafran met Eddy Galland and David Kellman at the age of 19, they knew something very strange was going on. The three young men were identical. It took years to uncover the secret psychological experiment, which they were all unknowingly a part of. Rina Roat is a successful clothes designer and entrepreneur from Cambodia, but she grew up far removed from the world of fashion. As a child, she had been abandoned and left homeless by her mother. Too poor to buy clothes, she turned to dressmaking â€“ hand-stitching her first frock from a pair of old curtains when she was just 12 years old. It set Rina on a course to create her own clothing line, while never losing sight of another dream: finding out what happened to her mother and the family she never knew.
