In April 2014, Boko Haram attacked a school in the small town of Chibok, Nigeria, kidnapping over 200 schoolgirls. Ten months later, the girls have not been set free. But a small group of girls in Chibok did manage to avoid the militants. And 21 of them are now defying Boko Harm by continuing their education. They have been encouraged by the president of the American University of Nigeria, Margee Ensign. She has arranged for scholarships for many of the girls to study at the university in the city of Yola. We spoke to Margee, and two of the girls. In 2012 the British opera singer Toby Spence underwent an operation to remove cancer from his throat. He spent the next three years in recovery and he recorded the singing lessons he had with his music teacher to monitor his progress. He is now back at the Royal Opera House in London. In 1964, Australian Reg Spiers was an athlete, who found himself in London without any money and desperate to get home, on the other side of the world. So he posted himself in a box from London to Australia - with the help of his English friend, and fellow javelin-thrower, John McSorley. We got both of them together to tell the story.
