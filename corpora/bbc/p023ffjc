Commissioner Miguel Martinez Madrid is head of the Honduran Special Tactical Operations Group. He used to tackle drug crime, but now spends his time trying to stop smugglers known as 'coyotes' transporting children illegally across the border. Lindsey, from Minnesota in the United States, became so fed up with being sexually harassed in the street on her way to work that she decided to take action. When a passerby says or does something she finds offensive Lindsey challenges them about their behaviour - and films the encounters on her phone. Dario Gambarin uses a tractor to cut huge portraits of world leaders into the Italian countryside. His picture of Nelson Mandela went viral when the former South African president died. His work is now well-known, despite the initial disapproval of his farmer father. Claire Hajaj grew up in the Middle East and the UK, in a very unusual family. That's because her mother is Jewish and her father is Palestinian. Claire believes that although her parents' relationship couldn't ultimately survive the strain of their different backgrounds, as their child she can occupy the middle ground and give hope to others. Her new novel, inspired by her parents, is called Ishmael's Oranges.
