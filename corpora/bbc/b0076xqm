Actress Penelope Keith nominates legendary comedy double-act Morecambe and Wise as masters of classless entertainment. On Christmas day in 1977, almost 29 million people sat down to watch Morecambe And Wise on BBC One. With false noses galore, Penelope co-starred alongside them in Ernie's play Cyrano de Bergerac. After this show, the duo defected back to ITV. So will Penelope's two heroes stand up to intensive scrutiny from Mathew Parris and merit the description of having led great lives? With Eric Morecambe's son Gary, who offers some fascinating insights into his father's background and how he viewed his success. Producer: Miles Warde First broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in November 2006.
