Mohna Ansari is the first Muslim woman to become a lawyer in Nepal. She is also the only female member of the country's prestigious Human Rights Commission. But Mohna's rise to the top was not always easy. Muslims are a minority community in Nepal and she says she often faced discrimination growing up. Midwife Lisa Peberdy has spent her career working in Australia's most remote communities. She once had to deliver a baby in a small dinghy in crocodile-infested waters but she has always managed to stay calm in some alarming situations. Fabiola Nizigiyimana is a Burundian refugee. She was born into a farming family who fled their native Burundi to escape war. They sought refuge in Rwanda, but were forced to leave when the genocide began. She is now back on a farm - this time in Massachusetts in the United States. British actor Hugh Grant is starring in a new film based on the life of American socialite Florence Foster Jenkins. Hugh discusses working on the film with the triple Oscar-winning actress Meryl Streep and why this film convinced him to come back to the big screen. (Photo: Mohna Ansari. Credit: Ekantipur) Show less
