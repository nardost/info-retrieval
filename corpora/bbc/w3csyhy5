Friends Azim Khamisa and Ples Felix share a fondness for spicy food and wine, but their relationship has a deeper and more profound resonance. They volunteer to talk to young people about ways to stop gun violence. Because more than 20 years ago, Ples's grandson killed Azim's son. Neal Razzell hears their story. Akram Khan is one of the world's leading dancers and choreographers. Over the years, he's notched up numerous accolades, collaborated with prima ballerinas and pop stars, and danced in impressive venues - including an Olympic opening ceremony. But, as he tells Outlook's Saskia Edwards, his first stage was his family's Indian restaurant. Image: L: Azim Khamisa and R: Ples Felix Credit: Tariq Khamisa Foundation Show less
