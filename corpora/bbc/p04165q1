In August 2014, the Sinjar region in northern Iraq, home to the minority Yazidi community, was taken over by the so-called Islamic State. The group went from village to village killing the men and capturing the women. Lamiya Haji Bashar is an 18 year old Yazidi woman who grew up in Kocho, a village which Amnesty International say IS 'tried to wipe off the map.' After several attempts, Lamiya made a courageous escape. Hiroki Terai believes Japanese people are not very good at expressing their emotions and he is on a mission to make them cry. He runs a business that allows people to hire a handsome man to play them sad video clips and wipe away their tears. Kunal Nayyar is one of the stars of the American comedy series The Big Bang Theory about four geeky scientists who struggle with everyday social skills. Adele Devonshire was diving off the coast of Scotland when she lost her camera. Three years later, the camera has been found and returned to her. (Picture: Lamiya Haji Bashar. Credit: AP.) Show less
