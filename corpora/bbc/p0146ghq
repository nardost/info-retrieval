The shocking story of the little boy from Bangladesh who was brutally maimed by gangsters so he could raise more money for them as a beggar. He was only saved from death because his parents organised a search for him. Also the American soldier who believes that in 1989 she became the first woman to lead troops in combat. And in the spirit of Valentine's Day, an unusual love story - the disabled dancer who married her childhood sweetheart thirty years on. Picture: Outlook presenter, Matthew Bannister Show less
