Afghan chief Malek Nematullah Halimi has spent more than 20 years breaking down taboos by helping couples with problems in the bedroom. Even though he's not a qualified therapist, his counselling services have attracted couples from all over Afghanistan. Matthew Bannister also talks to two men from rival gangs in Birmingham, UK, who risked their lives to agree a truce between the opposing sides. An Inuit campaigner tells why she believes seal hunting is essential to her community's survival. And we meet the Malian man who tried to save ancient manuscripts from Islamist militants.
