This has been the decade of the NGOs (Non-Governmental Organisations). Their numbers, influence and range of activities have grown enormously. Many are now multi-million pound organisations. While many NGOs conduct themselves well, there are increasing worries about the accountability of NGOs and the extent to which the work they do is appropriate in the host countries. Allan Little looks at the work of NGOs in Malawi, India and Haiti, to consider some key concerns. In this episode he focusses on Haiti. Why, for example, does there seem to be so little co-ordination between NGOs in a place like Haiti? Why, despite the vast effort and resources that flowed after the earthquake two years ago, are people still living in tents without basic amenities?
