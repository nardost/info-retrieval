Nikolai Kozak grew up thinking his father Roberto was a quiet diplomat. Then one day he found out he'd helped save 30,000 political prisoners from persecution under Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile. As Pinochet began persecuting his opponents, Roberto was determined to help them. He negotiated a deal to allow political prisoners to go into exile, and at great risk to himself, he personally escorted people to airports, or safe locations - he even hid people in his house. Nikolai, now an artist, tells the story of his father, and Rodrigo del Villar Canas - who as a student had been detained by Pinochet - describes how Roberto helped him flee. John Wilson, the British conductor and arranger trying to rescue a piece of Hollywood history. From The Wizard of Oz to Singin' in the Rain, he's spent years piecing together the lost scores of classic movie musicals - note by note.
