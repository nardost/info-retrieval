After eight months spent as a hostage in Libya, Filippo Calcagno decided to escape using a rusty nail to pick the lock of his cell. When Wayetu Moore was a little girl in the 1990s, her homeland, Liberia, was plunged into civil war. Her dad grabbed her and her sisters, and got them out of the capital, Monrovia and then out of the country, to the United States. Now 30 years old, Wayetu has gone back to Monrovia on a very personal mission, to open a book shop. Argentinian artist Amalia Ullman appeared to lead a glamorous life in Los Angeles and would often post pictures of herself on social media. But it was all a hoax and part of her latest art project. Iraqi lawyer and women's rights activist, Suaad Allami, has faced multiple threats to her life because of her work. She explains what it is that keeps her fighting for women's rights in Baghdad.
