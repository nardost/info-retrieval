Colombian investigative journalist Maria Duzan fought drug cartels with her pen. When she worked as a journalist in Bogota, she had bodyguards 24/7 and was taught to fire a gun. Maria kept reporting even after her editor was killed by Pablo Escobar’s hitmen and her newsroom was bombed by paramilitary groups. When Eva Sam left Macau to emigrate to New York, she never thought she would become one of the most famous women in Chinatown. Eva and her son William run a shop that supplies jewellery for hip hop royalty, from ASAP Rocky to Beyoncé. Tara Gadomski has the story. Sharon Berry is the founder of Storybook Dads, a UK charity that records audio and video of inmates reading bedtime stories to their children. Esa Abrate is originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo but he grew up in Italy. Although he is only 20 years old, Esa conducts orchestras all over the country and he has recently received an award from Italy's President for his work as a musician.
