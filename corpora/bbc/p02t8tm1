Dr Ahmad Sarmast has been trying to revive traditional music in Afghanistan, after years of Taliban rule when music was banned because they considered it un-Islamic. His music school in Kabul teaches orphans and street children - and girls, which has angered extremists. Six months ago, during a performance in Kabul, a suicide bomber blew himself up in the audience, killing one person. Dr Sarmast's hearing was severely damaged. But he has not been deterred. Cape Town's historic Greenmarket Square is famous for its street performers. There are jugglers, dancers, mime artists - but one man stands out for his rather unorthodox talent. William Jafta is known simply as the 'animal sound man'. Reporter Mohammed Allie went to see him in action. The British Special Air Service - or SAS - does not allow women in its ranks. But about 15 years ago, they briefly allowed women to take part in the gruelling training for this elite force. Azi Ahmed is one of just two women who lasted the distance, and has written a book about her experiences, Worlds Apart: A Muslim Girl with the SAS. Bosnian Sejla Kameric was living in Sarajevo during the four years it was under siege in the 1990s. A bitter ethnic war was raging following the break-up of Yugoslavia. Sejla is now an award-winning artist, and tells Nicki Paxman that her work, including her latest art installation in London, was shaped by that experience. (Photo: Ahmad Sarmast.
