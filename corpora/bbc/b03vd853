Charlie Chaplin's City Lights is ranked by The American Film Institute as one of the best American films ever made. A silent film released after the introduction of sound into cinema, it was also one of Chaplin's most commercially successful releases. To mark the centenary of Chaplin's iconic tramp character, Matthew Sweet discusses City Lights with comedian Lucy Porter, actor Paul McGann, film maker and historian Kevin Brownlow, and Chaplin's biographer David Robinson. Recorded in front of a live audience at the Watershed Arts Centre as part of the Bristol Slapstick Festival.
