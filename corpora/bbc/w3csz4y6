"Raindrops on Roses and Whiskers on Kittens"...this week Soul Music and guests from around the world share their special memories of The Sound of Music classic My Favourite Things. Written by Rodgers and Hammerstein in 1959 this deceptively simple song has travelled the globe to comfort and enthral children the world over. Iranian astronaut and philanthropist Anousheh Ansari's first encounter with this musical classic was in her native language of Farsi. It is a melody she held dear to her during years of unrest through the Iranian revolution and the war that was to follow. It is also the song that travelled with her as she realised her childhood dream of exploring outer space.
