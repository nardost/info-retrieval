Andrea Quint Fleck and her hairdresser Troy Winget bonded over Andrea's hair, the spark was apparent at their first appointment in their home town of Calgary. By coincidence both had question marks over their family history and they decided to do some research. But what they discovered rocked both their worlds. Andile Masuku takes Outlook to the top of Johannesburg's Westcliff Steps, a popular training spot for walkers and runners, to meet Masingita Masunga. Masingita was always told she would never run or drive, because she has cerebral palsy, but she doesn't listen to people who try to limit her. Masingita recently completed a marathon as well as summiting Africa's highest peak, Mount Kilimanjaro. Author and professor Mitchell S Jackson is a style connoisseur and likes to look good. But, there's no dressing up the drama of his dark past as a drug dealer and his journey to redemption. Picture: Troy Winget and Andrea Quint Fleck Credit: Troy Winget and Andrea Quint Fleck Show less
