This week Quentin Cooper talks to three people who are each guilty of very different charges of entrapment: astronomer Ray Jayawardhana is part of a movement building the most elaborate and expensive traps to snare the most elusive prey of all – neutrinos; games designer Margaret Robertson lures us into them for our own pleasure – the trick, though, is making them just sticky enough to evade or escape from, to keep players coming back for more; and wildlife ecologist Bill McShea uses ever-improving digital technology to develop cunning camera traps that catch glimpses of animals in the wild without disturbing their normal behaviour.
