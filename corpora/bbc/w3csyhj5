As a British-Pakistani teenager growing up in 1980s Luton, Sarfraz Manzoor didn’t think his future held huge promise – that is until he discovered the music of Bruce Springsteen. Sarfraz could relate to The Boss – they both came from working class backgrounds and both had challenging relationships with their fathers. But if Springsteen had made it to the top, maybe Sarfraz could too. He's now a successful writer and journalist. Emily Webb speaks to Sarfraz and finds out how his story was turned into the film Blinded by the Light. Picture: Sarfraz Manzoor with Bruce Springsteen Credit: Courtesy of Sarfraz Manzoor Show less
