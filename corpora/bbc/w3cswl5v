When film-maker Neary Adeline Hay was a child, she had so many questions about her fatherâ€™s past in Cambodia. The story he told her was so shocking she decided the world needed to hear it. The documentary she made is called Angkar. Marine ecologist Sallie Beavers and her colleagues found two baby octopuses clinging onto a plastic bottle off the coast of Hawaii's Big Island. They rescued the tiny creatures and released them back into the wild. Denis O'Regan is a rock photographer. A series of lucky coincidences took him on tour with incredible acts like Queen, the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd. But one of his most intimate portraits is of David Bowie. On the Serious Moonlight tour in 1983 Denis got extraordinary access to the star. He has collected those pictures in a book, Ricochet. (Photo: Neary Adeline Hay and her dad.
