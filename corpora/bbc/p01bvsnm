Korean-American Chong Kim was sold into the sex trade when she was 18 by the man she thought was her boyfriend. She now helps police to track down human traffickers. Also on the programme, Rebecca Henschke goes riding with the child jockeys of the island of Sumba, Indonesia - some as young as four years old. Saudi Arabia's first female film director Haifaa al-Mansour talks about her new film Wadjda, about an 11-year-old girl dreaming of owning a bicycle. And, Australian Robyn Catchlove, author of Somewhere Down A Lazy River, tells how she ran away to sea in the 1960s and took on crocodiles, sea snakes and rival fishermen. Show less
