CAPTAIN CHESLEY SULLENBERGER On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 was cleared for takeoff at 3:24 pm from Runway 4 at La Guardia airport in New York. Its destination was Charlotte, Carolina. One hundred and fifty passengers boarded the plane along with 5 crew members for what was expected to be an entirely uneventful flight. Boarding and take off had been just like any other day. But it turned out very differently. Captain Sullenberger was forced to make one of the most remarkable emergency landings in aviation history, on the Hudson river. He spoke to Matthew Bannister about his thoughts and emotions in the most eventful 208 seconds of his life. Book - Highest Duty: My Search for what Really Matters. Show less
