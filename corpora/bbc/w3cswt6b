In 2004, American college students Spencer Reinhard and Warren Lipka - along with two other friends - hatched an elaborate and oddball scheme to steal some of the worldâ€™s rarest and most valuable books. Inspired by Hollywood heist thrillers and a desperate urge to escape their mundane suburban lives, they disguised themselves as old men and prepared to inflitrate the treasured archive of their university library. However, everything that could go wrong, did. And what started as an exciting crime caper changed their lives forever.
