Last Broadcast Date: 09 September 1996
A report on the discovery of some well-preserved Pterodactyl skeletons. The consensus among scientists that the Pterodactyl failed to evolve has come under question following the analysis of the remains, which shows they were not quite as poorly adapted for flying compared with birds. Also in the programme, how a bad gene turned good and a dip into a strange state of matter. Presenter: Andrew Luck-Baker. Show less
