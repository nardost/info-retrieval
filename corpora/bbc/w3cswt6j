When she was 17 years old, Piera Aiello was forced to marry into a notorious Sicilian Mafia family. After witnessing the murder of her husband, she became a police informant. However the decision meant she had to go into hiding - giving up her name, her family, and wearing a veil when she went outside. Now, after 25 years, Piera has decided to show her face in public for the first time. Presenter: Emily Webb Image: Piera Aiello Credit: Alamy Show less
