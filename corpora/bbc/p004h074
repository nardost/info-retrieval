Indian Farmer Suicides - the children left behind Following a severe drought, farmers in the south Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have been hit hard by flooding. Last week, more than 250 people were killed in floods and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crops were wiped out. Andhra Pradesh is already one of the states with the highest number of farmer suicides. Tinku Ray has been meeting some of the orphans left behind. Refusing to play ball This month, an amateur Muslim soccer team in France has provoked an outcry after refusing to play against a team that promotes homosexual rights and has gay players. The Creteil Bebel Muslim team pulled out of its planned tie with Paris Foot Gay (PFG), saying it went against their religious beliefs to play against homosexuals. George Arney spoke to the coach of Paris Foot Gay, Brahim Nait-Balk. He has written a memoir entitled "Un Homo Dans La Cite" about growing up gay as part of the North African community in the poorest suburbs of Paris. Evacuating the Carterets The inhabitants of the Carteret Islands off the coast of Papua New Guinea are the first entire population to be officially evacuated because of climate change. Last Christmas, sea water overwhelmed the islands during a storm surge and most of the cultivated land was destroyed. Now, with fears growing worldwide over rising sea-levels, an evacuation plan is underway. The young journalist Dan Box won a competition run by the Royal Geographical Society and the BBC to record a journey of a life time. He travelled to Bougainville to meet some of the people who are being evacuated. Show less
