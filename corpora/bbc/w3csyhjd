Majeda Khoury loved to cook for her family back home in Damascus, so when conflict broke out in Syria she used her skills to help the displaced people fleeing the bombs. She smuggled food across checkpoints, but she was arrested and detained. Once she was released, she had to flee the country, leaving her two sons behind. Majeda moved to the UK where she used food to raise awareness about the conflict in her home country. Anatomist Gunther Van Hagens and his wife Dr Angelina Whalley have dedicated their life to showing people just how incredible human bodies are. Their exhibition Body Worlds has been shown in cities across the world - on display are entire human bodies without their skin. Angelina is the curator and has been speaking to Outlook's Mariana Des Forges about her husband's request to be put in the exhibition when he dies. Fashion designer Danit Peleg has become known for designing and 3D-printing a whole collection from her room. It took her more than 2,000 hours with six 3D printers up and running 24/7. Danit is on this year's BBC's 100 Most Influential Women list. You can find more information from the BBC 100 Women link below. (Photo: Syrian chef Majeda Khoury serving food.
