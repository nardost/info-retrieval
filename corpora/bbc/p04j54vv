Burhan Sönmez is a Turkish novelist who was detained in Istanbul when he was a teenager during a political clampdown in the 1980s. He describes how he and his fellow inmates would escape into their imaginations to cope with torture and interrogation. Suresh De Silva founded the Sri Lankan heavy metal band Stigmata 16 years ago. They are hugely popular with metal fans around the world but they faced a backlash in Sri Lanka when they started out. Yves Rossy is known as the 'Jetman', because he wants to swap his plane for a pair of wings. The Swiss former fighter pilot is so obsessed with birds that he has developed a winged jetpack to fly around in. (Picture: Burhan Sönmez. Photo credit: Kaan Saganak.) Show less
