In the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the war in Afghanistan, Andrew Marr discusses foreign intervention with the Conservative MP Rory Stewart and the former intelligence officer, Frank Ledwidge. Stewart looks back at the conflict to ask whether simple notions of winning foreign wars is counterproductive, while Ledwidge turns a critical eye on the army's lack of strategic thinking which he argues led to catastrophic failures in both Iraq and Afghanistan. The BBC's security correspondent Gordon Corera discusses the role of the British secret service, from the Cold War days of spies lurking in the shadows, to the disaster of the 'dodgy dossier' on Iraq. And Dr Rosemary Hollis, Professor of Middle East Policy Studies, considers the impact of recent revelations of complicity with Gaddafi's regime, and how 9/11 has skewed international relations.
