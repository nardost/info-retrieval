Mahmoud Abou Zeid, known as Shawkan, is an Egyptian photojournalist. He's been in jail for more than 600 days - without trial - after covering the crackdown on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo in 2013. Hear extracts from letters he's written from Cairo's notorious Tora prison, and from an American journalist Mike Giglio who was arrested alongside him but quickly freed. Austrian Tanja Erhart had her left leg amputated when she was six years old. But despite that she's become a successful professional dancer - although she had to leave Austria to do it. She's now rehearsing for The Show Must Go On, with mixed ability dance company, Candoco in the UK. In 1958 a young woman called Joan Williams was chosen to represent the city of Pasadena, California, in their annual Rose Parade. But when it emerged that Joan was African American, although fair skinned, she was dropped from her role as Miss Crown City and the parade. This year she finally took her place on the parade, 57 years late, and has been honoured by the Californian State Legislature's Black Caucus for her "courage and determination in overcoming discrimination". David Morris is a World Whistling Champion who's given up his job to travel the world performing concerts, as well as recording for CDs, television commercials and film soundtracks.
