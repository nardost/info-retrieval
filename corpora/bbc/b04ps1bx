ANNE MCELVOY talks to the British Academy Medal winning historian GEOFFREY PARKER about his influential game-changing account of the political and social upheavals which characterised the Seventeenth Century around the world. In 'GLOBAL CRISIS: WAR, CLIMATE CHANGE AND CATASTROPHE', Parker reflects on how extreme weather conditions exacerbated crises in the affairs of states from Ireland to China, how governments responded well or badly, and what the lessons might be for today's Global Governance. As TATE MODERN opens an exhibition CONFLICT TIME AND PHOTOGRAPHY, former New Generation Thinker Dr ZOE NORRIDGE from Kings' College London discusses images of war with Austrian photographer ALEX SCHLACHER, who has spent 3 years with the Gurkhas and has documented the work of US Marines in Afghanistan as well as law enforcement in the US and Austria. The 25th anniversary of the 1989 Polish TV drama series THE DECALOGUE directed by KRZYSZTOF KIESLOWSKI is being marked by a series of screenings at the ICA GALLERY in London, at JW3 and DEPTFORD CINEMA. AGATA PYZIK, author of POOR BUT SEXY: CULTURE CLASHES IN EUROPE EAST AND WEST and MICHAEL GODDARD, co-ed POLISH CINEMA IN A TRANSNATIONAL CONTEXT discuss an auteur director more interested in the general human condition than politics per se. CONFLICT TIME AND PHOTOGRAPHY runs at TATE MODERN from 26 November 2014 - 15 March 2015 Producer: Jacqueline Smith. Show less
