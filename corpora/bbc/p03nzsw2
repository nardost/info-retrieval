As part of the BBC World Service Season on Identity, The Why Factor examines one simple question: Who are you? Did you choose your identity or was it given to you? Mike Williams asks how our identities are created and if that shapes the way we see the world, and the way the world sees us. (Crowds on Oxford Street, London UK. Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty) Show less
