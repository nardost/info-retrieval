How many stars can you see at night? As artificial light spreads, humans are increasingly cut off from one of the most awe inspiring sights in nature. American writer Paul Bogard thinks that natural darkness is a wonder that we should treasure, and he's travelled the world in search of it. The result is a book called The End of Night. Lithuanian brothers Aleksey and Evgeniy Olechnovic have ordinary jobs in London. But at weekends they put on armour, pick up their swords and become medieval knights. They are leading the British team in the sport of Medieval Combat Fighting which is growing in popularity across Europe. Tessa Dunlop reports. In South Africa, according to local charities, more than 2000 children are abandoned every year. As they grow up, many of these orphans end up fending for themselves on the streets. And, only too often, they fall prey to criminal gangs who exploit them and abuse them. Thirteen years ago, Khanyisile Motsa was working as a businesswoman in Johannesburg. A chance meeting with some young orphaned street girls convinced her that she needed to do something to help. And now she runs a shelter for orphaned girls, largely paid for with her own money. The singer Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer has been called the German Bruce Springsteen. He has sold over 18 million albums, and one of them is the country's best selling album of all time. Most of his output so far has been sung in German, but his new release I Walk is in English. It features guest appearances by Bono of U2 and Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons. Herbert's also an actor, and has appeared in award-winning films. He spoke to Anna McNamee. (Picture: The Milky Way seen in the skies over Afghanistan.
