Hamburg now has 39,000 refugees living in and around the city. The city's government expects that figure to double by the end of this year. The influx of people is the topic of conversation in the city, and one which is followed by all ages. Each year the BBC recruits young people to tell the stories of interest to their community. This year we have a special documentary made by the students of Helene-Lange Gymnasium, a bi-lingual secondary school, in Hamburg. They chose to investigate how Migration was changing their home town. For BBC News School Report, School Reporter Cathleen, who is 15, takes us on a tour of her city to meet politicians, townspeople and the new migrants as they make Hamburg home.
