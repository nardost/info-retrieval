Yoshiki is one of Japan's biggest stars. He founded the rock band X Japan, which transformed the music scene in Japan. They spawned a whole new style - over the top outfits, wild stage performances - and sold 30 million records. He told us how he managed to express his feelings through music after his father's suicide; and how he lost his childhood friend and lead singer to a cult. Henri Nyakarundi, the entrepreneur on a mission to bring solar-powered charging kiosks to places in East Africa with limited electricity supply. And the real life hobbit Yury Alekseyev, a Russian lawyer who gave up city life to live in the wilderness with his pet rabbit, Petrushka. He runs a lending library from his tent.
