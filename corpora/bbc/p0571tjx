Give back the Land is the cry from millions of black and brown South African farm workers who have been dispossessed of their land for centuries. They expected to gain an equal share in the wealth of the land when Nelson Mandela was elected in 1994. That has not happened. And their patience is running out, leading to fears of a racial conflagration that the country cannot afford. A white land owner, together with the workers on the farm he inherited, have embarked on a bold project to share ownership of the land they all love and live on. This is the story of their struggles and triumphs as they find a way to give back the land. Presenter: Audrey Brown (Photo: Farm workers sit on the back of a tractor during harvest time.
