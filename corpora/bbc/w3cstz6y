Earlier this year Norodin Alonto Lucman saved 144 people when extremist militants linked to the so-called Islamic State attacked the city of Marawi on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. Norodin's family are prominent Muslim political leaders in the area and he risked his life by sheltering those fleeing the violence, many of whom were Christians. People who suffer from kidney disease often need regular dialysis to keep them alive. Getting access to the treatment when they travel can be very challenging. But now help is at hand. Javier Artigas from Uruguay had kidney disease himself. He's formed a partnership with one of the world's most successful tech billionaires to create an app which connects patients to dialysis treatment all over the world. When the recent earthquake struck central Mexico, many people rushed to help those who were trapped, injured or left homeless. Fashion designer Brisa Alonso came up with a very original way of helping the rescue efforts. She designed and made boots for the search and rescue dogs. Mark Elie is a British professional dancer who has set up a dance school to help children from poor backgrounds get into his profession. His mission comes from his own experiences of growing up in a children's home in west London. Image: Norodin Alonto Lucman (L) being interviewed Credit: BBC Show less
