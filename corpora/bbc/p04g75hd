In the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, 800,000 people were killed in the space of 100 days. There was a small United Nations force in Rwanda at the start of the killing to assist in the implementation of a peace deal. During the conflict, Canadian general Romeo Dallaire did everything he could to protect Tutsis from Hutu extremists, and is credited with saving tens of thousands of lives. But he has never recovered from what he witnessed. He has suffered with post-traumatic stress disorder for two decades, and has thrown himself into humanitarian work as a way to deal with it. He was in the UK recently at the Rising Global Peace Forum, where he was speaking about his Child Soldiers Initiative. In the United Arab Emirates falcons have been an integral part of desert life. They are so revered that in Abu Dhabi they even have their own hospital. Outlook's Colm Flynn went to the Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital to meet the woman who runs it, Dr Margit Muller. Marina Abramovic is widely considered the "Godmother of Performance Art". She is something of a cult figure in the art world, with a 50-year career in which she has put on daring performances that often test her limits. Her work regularly involves nudity, self-harm, and sheer recklessness. (Photo: Lieutenant-General Romeo Dallaire. Credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Show less
