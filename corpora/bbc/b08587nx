For many piano music lovers, Dinu Lipatti, the Romanian concert pianist, stands head and shoulders above others. He lived during a time of great turbulence, leaving his native Romania for Switzerland at the outbreak of the second World War. He left behind a wealthy family but they subsequently lost everything under communism. Next year is the centenary of his birth, and food writer and former chef Orlando Murrin explains his love for Lipatti's music and his fascination with his life. It has led him to spending time trying to save Lipatti's family home from demolition in Bucharest. He joins Matthew Parris and the London based Romanian concert pianist Alexandra Dariescu to champion the life and work of one of classical music's greatest 20th century talents.
