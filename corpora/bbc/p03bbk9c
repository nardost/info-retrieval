Two years after the fall of Colonel Gaddafi, twenty three of Libya’s finest science and technology graduates spent a year at Cambridge University in England. The plan was that these young people would acquire the skills to rebuild their country. The project was organised by Tatweer, a new Libyan research and development company. Their aim was that when the graduates returned to Libya they would set up a technology park in the city of Benghazi which would be at the forefront of scientific research – not just for Libya but for the whole region. This is the story of the graduates’ year in Cambridge and how the reality on the ground back home raised big questions about whether their dream can ever be realised. When they go back, they return to a Libya engulfed in civil war. (Photo: Children visiting Libya's Red Castle and National Museum in Tripoli.
