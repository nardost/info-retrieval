Paul Moss travels to Ghana and Senegal to assess the wider impact of Ebola in Africa. Beach resorts are quiet, investors are pulling out and there is widespread concern that a disease which has hit neighbouring countries could have a long-term impact on the entire continent. We also hear from those countries where Ebola is present - Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The Senegalese musician Baaba Maal talks to Paul, and also joining us will be a panel of guests which will discuss the issues raised.
