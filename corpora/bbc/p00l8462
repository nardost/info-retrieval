As the world’s population is set to reach seven billion soon, we ask how we’re going to be able to feed everyone. We take an in depth look at food, from how it is produced, to how it is prepared and ingested. Leading environmentalist Dr Jason Clay unveils his radical and controversial plan to make food production all over the world more sustainable. Award winning cookery writer Claudia Roden believes that traditional home cooking is vital when it comes to feeding ourselves. And Harvard anthropologist Prof Richard Wrangham says we need to learn more about the physics of food so that we can make better nutritional decisions. Illustration by Emily Kasriel Show less
