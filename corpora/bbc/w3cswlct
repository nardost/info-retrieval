In the 1980s Sheila Wysocki shared a college dorm room in Texas with a woman called Angela Samota. The pair became very close despite their personalities being very different. Then, in 1984, tragedy struck: Angela was raped and murdered. There were leads in the case, but eventually it went cold. Then, two decades after Angela's death, Sheila decided to become a private investigator to solve the case. But, would she be able to find the killer? The Italian city of Venice is famous for its canals. If you've been there, you'll know it's easy to be distracted by the grandeur of the houses, the palaces, the churches and bridges. But it's worth looking below the surface too. Outlook's Alessia Cerantola crossed the Venetian lagoon to meet an underwater explorer called Captain Pipa, who's on the hunt for a mythical sunken treasure.
