As closed Senate meetings look at covert activities, it's time to work to avoid a crippled presidency. The sound quality on this recording is variable/poor. This archive edition of Letter from America was recorded by one of two listeners, who between them taped and labelled over 650 Letter From America programmes from 1973 to 1989. It was restored by the BBC in 2014. Show less
