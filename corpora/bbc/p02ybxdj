When Trevor Thomas lost his sight after an autoimmune disease he thought he would no longer be able to continue to enjoy extreme sports. But instead he's managed to hike more than 6,000 miles, with the help of his guide dog Tennille. He tells Jo Fidgen about their extraordinary journey. Natasha Noman is a young, gay, American journalist who decided to get out of her comfort zone and explore her Pakistani roots by moving to Karachi. She's turned her experience into a one-woman play, currently showing at the Edinburgh Festival called "No-man's Land". She tells Pooneh Ghoddosi what it was like to come out in Pakistan. The town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia has had a traumatic history. Twenty years ago, around 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed by Serb forces, and those Muslims who survived were effectively driven out of town. Outlook reporter Jo Impey has been there and hears the story of two restaurant-owners - each with a very different perspective. Sudanese swimmer Sara Gadalla contracted polio as a young child and has had trouble walking ever since. But she's now become Sudan's first female swimming star. She tells Jo Fidgen how swimming changed people's perception of her. (Photo: Trevor Thomas and his guide dog, Tennille. Credit: Trevor Thomas) Show less
