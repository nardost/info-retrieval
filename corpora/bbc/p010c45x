What is the best way to listen in a world full of noise? This week we are celebrating the 90th anniversary of BBC Radio with a special programme in front of a live audience at the Radio Theatre in Broadcasting House in London. Carrie Gracie is joined by Australian audiologist and stand-up comedian David McAlpine, who tells us how noisy parties bring out the best in our sense of hearing; Scottish-Indian poet Imtiaz Dharker who says poetry helps us listen to each other; and American radio producer Davia Nelson who suggests that radio is the best thing for stimulating your imagination.
