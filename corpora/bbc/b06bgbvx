Start the Week returns for a new series with a discussion about cultural exchange. Andrew Marr talks to the potter Edmund de Waal about his fascination with porcelain. De Waal's journey to understand the history and secrets of 'white gold' takes him from China to Europe and the USA. From white pots to multi-coloured: the contemporary Chinese artist Ai Weiwei mounts an exhibition at the Royal Academy; co-curator Tim Marlow explores his cultural significance. The poet Annie Freud takes inspiration from shards of pottery found in her garden for her collection, The Remains. Producer: Katy Hickman. Show less
