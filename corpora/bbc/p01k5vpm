Bulgarian-born journalist and film-maker Mimi Chakarova describes how she spent seven years infiltrating the international sex industry to expose the horrors of human trafficking. Also on the programme, Cuban dancer Carlos Acosta explains how he combines a writing career with being an international ballet star. He has just published a novel called Pig's Foot spanning a hundred years of Cuban history. Plus, American Jessica Alexander gives an inside view of the pressures and challenges faced by aid workers. Her memoir is called Chasing Chaos: My Decade In and Out of Humanitarian Aid. Vietnamese mother Ly Dinh and her son Teddy Nguyen share their story of estrangement and then mutual support after she discovered he was homosexual. (Picture: Mimi Chakarov.
