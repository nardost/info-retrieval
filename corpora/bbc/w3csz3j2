In 2016 when #MeToo spread around the world, thousands of women followed in France using the hashtag #balancetonporc (expose your pig). Some criticised the aggressive wording of the hashtag itself, others didn’t agree with the call to name perpetrators. French women made headlines around the world earlier this year when the actress Catherine Deneuve and one hundred other French women signed a letter accusing the #MeToo campaign of censorship and intolerance and defending the right to flirt. Men also got involved, complaining about the movement. Why was #MeToo so controversial in France? Was it lost in translation? Is France not ready to have an open debate on this yet? Who is resisting the change? French journalist Helene Daouphars meets activists, journalists, students and historians, trying to understand what’s going on in France.
