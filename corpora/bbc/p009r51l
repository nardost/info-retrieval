MARK PRINCE Mark Prince was full of anger and hatred when his fifteen year old son Kiyan was stabbed to death outside his school in London. But despite initially wanting to kill the young man who had stabbed his son, he found the strength to forgive him. Mark has now set up a charity in Kiyan's name which helps to turn other teenagers away from knife crime. MAGIC COW Angela Robson travels to Rwanda to meet a couple whose entire families were killed during the genocide in 1994. Thanks to a government scheme which gives a cow to some of the poorest in society, the couples lives have been transformed. The cow they were given in 2004 has been named "the magic cow" by villagers because she has given birth so many times. Show less
