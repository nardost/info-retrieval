Ric O'Barry was a star dolphin trainer in the 1960s. He created television's first celebrity dolphin, Flipper. But after Flipper died in his arms, Ric made a dramatic U-turn and became an activist, determined that no dolphin should live in captivity. Ric now runs an organisation called Dolphin Project. Thando Ndlangisa and Joe Buthelezi are a young couple from Gauteng province in South Africa. They had trouble conceiving, so they went for fertility treatment. When Thando got pregnant, she was told she was expecting triplets. But when the couple got to the delivery room, there was a big surprise awaiting them... Outlook's Mpho Lakaje has the story. Jonah Littlesunday's sensitive performance of the Native American flute has comforted grieving families in Arizona for many years, including the State's former senator John McCain's close relatives. Jonah discovered he had a talent to soothe people's pain from a young age. Outlook's Tara Gadomski went to meet him. Image: Dolphin trainer Ric O'Barry with Flipper Credit: David Higgs Show less
