Meet He Liesheng - the man the Chinese media are calling "Eagle Dad". The former teacher from Nanjing has become famous for the gruelling tests of character he's devised for his four-year-old son. DuoDuo has had to do press-ups in the snow wearing just his underpants, sail a dinghy solo in the open sea, and climb Mount Fuji in Japan. He Liesheng tells Outlook why the characterisation of him as a cruel parent is wrong. Lucy Ash also talks to Benjamin Gilmour, the Australian paramedic who has gone around the world in an ambulance. His book is called Paramedico. And she meets Addisu Demissie and Junaid Jemal Sendi from Ethiopia, who have gone from street hawking to a sensational career in modern dance. Show less
