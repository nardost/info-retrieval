Matthew Bannister meets novelist Armistead Maupin, the writer best known for his Tales of the City series of novels set in San Francisco. Sami Shah is a stand-up comedian from Pakistan who now lives in a remote part of western Australia. Carmine Schiavone was an Italian Mafia boss who - by his own admission - was involved in at least fifty killings. But he had a dramatic change of heart when he discovered that his clan was dumping millions of tons of toxic waste on a site near the city of Naples. And Jezza Neuman, the film-maker behind our series about child poverty in the USA updates us on the progress of some of the children featured. (Picture: Armistead Maupin.
