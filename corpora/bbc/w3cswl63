At the end of summer in 2017, Edward Potter and his first mate Carl Sheperd headed out from Florida into the Gulf of Mexico for a fishing trip. While at sea, Hurricane Irma struck, leaving Edward and Carl at the mercy of high winds and huge waves. As the boat started to sink, they were told the coastguard were unable to help. Their only chance of rescue was a more unusual source, a large cruise ship. The captain in charge, Gaetano Gigliotti, recently won the 'International Maritime Award for Exceptional Bravery at Sea" for his actions. When Alix Fox was 17 years old she had an extreme allergic reaction after finishing her shift at the pub where she worked. She was rushed to hospital, but never experienced another reaction like that again. However, after that, something did change. It's unclear if it was caused by the allergic reaction, but Alix started to smell things that didn't exist when she had certain emotions or was in certain locations. She thinks she has something called olfactory synaesthesia. Image: satellite image of Hurricane Irma Credit: BBC Show less
