Jennifer Teege never knew her real family background. Her father was a Nigerian student in Germany and her mother was a German, but she was given up for adoption. Then, just seven years ago, she discovered by chance a memoir about her biological family. It revealed that her white grandfather - who she never knew - was Amon Goeth, a notorious Nazi commander who was executed for his war crimes and portrayed in the film Schindler's List by Ralph Fiennes. Khaled Al Saai, the Syrian calligrapher who fled into exile - his graphic art now reflects the destruction of his homeland Brian Robson, the man who nearly died trying to travel from Australia to Britain in a crate.
