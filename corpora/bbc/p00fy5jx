One year on from the Smolensk air crash, writer and historian Adam Zamoyski examines how Polish politics and society have been affected by the events of April 10 2010 - the day which saw the country lose its President and 95 other public servants and dignitaries. In the first programme, Adam visits Krakow and speaks to those who suffered personal loss, as well as citizens who were united in the spontaneous national grief that followed the crash. Adam also questions, how does a country recover politically, bureaucratically and mentally from such a debilitating blow and what did the citizen's reactions reveal about the Polish attitude towards its own history?
