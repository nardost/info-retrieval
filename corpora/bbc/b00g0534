CHINESE CAPITALISM On June1989 the tanks moved into Tiananmen Square, there was widespread shooting by Chinese soldiers and as the people lay dying on the streets of Beijing the student pro-democracy demonstration was brought to an end. In his new book Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics, the economist Yasheng Huang examines China’s change from a rural orientated liberalising entrepreneurial economy to a state led, urban based economy dedicated to the manufacture of foreign goods. Laurie Taylor is joined by Yasheng Huang and Will Hutton, Chief Executive of the Work Foundation and author of The Writing On The Wall: China in the 21st Century, to discuss the impact for China of its economic reforms as the world heads into recession. CONCEPTS IN EDUCATION “Think of the tools in a toolbox: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screwdriver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws. The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects.” A quotation from the introduction to a new book entitled Key Concepts in Education. Fred Inglis co-author with Lesley Aers outlines what this alphabetical guide has to offer and explores how familiar educational terms have been variously used by people with different material and philosophical interests.
