Like many other young Syrians, Hesham Modamani and his friend were desperate to leave their war-torn country and start a new life in Europe. They could not afford to pay a smuggler to take them by boat the five kilometres across the Mediterranean Sea from Turkey to Greece. So despite all the risks, they decided to swim the distance over night. Xian Zhang grew up in China at a time when musical instruments were hard to come by. Her parents were keen for her to learn the piano so found a way to build one for her. Now in her early forties, Xian is a highly respected conductor on the world stage. RJ Mitte stars as Walt Jr. in the hit American TV series 'Breaking Bad'. Like his character, RJ has cerebral palsy - a neurological condition that affects movement and coordination.
