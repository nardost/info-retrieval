Viv Albertine was a pioneering punk star of all-female band The Slits in the late 70s and early 80s. But after she had a daughter, she initially hid her musical past from her. She tells Jo Fidgen how she reconnected with punk. In Finnish Lapland, Oula Kotakorva used to brave the snow to drive his mobile library to far-flung communities - he was often their only visitor. He's only recently retired and has been reliving his icy past. Andargachew Tsege was a famous Ethiopian political dissident when he went missing at an airport in Yemen in 2014; he ended up in Ethiopia where he faced the death penalty. His partner, Yemi Hailemariam, describes their battle for justice and how they kept love alive on death row. Image: Viv Albertine Credit: Carolina Ambida Show less
