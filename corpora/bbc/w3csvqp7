Valeria Luiselli is an award winning Mexican author who also volunteers as an interpreter for undocumented child migrants arriving in the US from Central and Latin America. Josh Kantor is the organist for the Boston Red Sox baseball team. It's his job to spice up the atmosphere by playing songs that reflect the match. Reporter Karen Given went to meet him. The Philippines is home to one of the smallest primates in the world - the tarsier. Carlito Pizarras used to hunt the tiny furry animals with huge eyes, but realising their numbers were dwindling, he now fights to save them. Outlook's Aurora Almendral tracked down the man now known as 'Tarsier Man'. Art restorer Mary Schafer made an incredible discovery while working on a painting by the Dutch artist Vincent Van Gogh called Olive Trees. Embedded in the paint she found a small grasshopper.
