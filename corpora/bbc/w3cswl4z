Nicola Gratteri is one of Italy's most respected anti-mafia chief prosecutors and he has been living under 24/7 armed protection since 1989. Nicola grew up in a small town in Calabria, in the South of Italy, where he used to go to school with the sons of local mafia bosses. When he became a prosecutor he brought to court several of his childhood friends - as well as some of the most dangerous international mafia bosses.
