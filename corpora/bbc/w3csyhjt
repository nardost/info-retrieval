Haben Girma is a Harvard Law School graduate - an attorney. She has been invited to the White House and she is deaf and blind. With the help of her braille computer, she tells Emily Webb about the time she gave Barack Obama a hard time for typing with two fingers. Haben has published a book called Haben: The Deaf-blind Woman Who Conquered Harvard Law. Imagine a clock that takes up a whole room. Professor Murray Barrett is a physics professor from New Zealand who is trying to create the world's most precise clock, and it is not small. He works at the National University of Singapore and he is working towards making an atomic clock that uses the rare element lutetium. Eric McMillan is a pioneering adventure playground designer who changed the way children played in 1970s Toronto, Canada. Eric’s best known invention is the ball pit, inspired by a jar of pickled onions he came across in his kitchen. (Photo: Haben Girma meeting Barack Obama in 2015.
