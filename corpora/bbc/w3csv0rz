Bridget Kendall and guests examine the story of Detroit. Founded in 1701 by a French man named Cadillac, this American city became famous in the 20th Century for its automobile industry, the music of Motown, and the great unrest seen on the city’s streets in the summer of 1967. Bridget Kendall and guests discuss the city’s changing fortunes and its fascinating history, from the role played by some residents in the 'Underground Railroad’ of the 19th Century, to its recent experience of bankruptcy. Bridget is joined by Herb Boyd, Stephen Henderson, Thomas Sugrue and Anna Clark. Also featuring Tiya Miles and Carleton Gholz. (Photo: City of Detroit. Credit: AFP/Getty Images) Show less
