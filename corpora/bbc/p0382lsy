Hit Record: stories of people documenting lives. When photojournalist Sim Chi Yin from Singapore began to document the lives of Chinese gold miners, she never expected that she would become closely involved in the life of of her subjects. Former gold miner He Quangui had contracted silicosis - a lung disease that leaves sufferers desperately struggling to breathe. As Chi Yin got closer to He Quangui and his family, she found herself crossing the line from objective observer to life saver. Farzana Wahidy is a pioneering and award-winning photographer in Afghanistan. She's well known for her photographs of Afghan women and girls, showing the world from their perspective. Sometimes that means taking pictures through a burqa - the head-to-toe covering that women had to wear in Afghanistan during the rule of the Taleban. Farzana tells Jo Fidgen about her childhood and why she wanted to become a photographer. Lots of us might keep a diary or post updates about our lives on social media, but not many people go as far as Morris Villarroel. A university professor from Madrid, Morris has been recording his life in intricate detail for the past five years. He carries a notebook with him at all times but has now started wearing a camera which takes photos every thirty seconds. Fifty years ago, Egyptian writer, Nawal el-Saadawi wrote a novel that shocked the establishment and really thrust her into the forefront of the fight for women's rights in the Middle East. In 1981 she found herself jailed for her outspoken views and as a political prisoner she wasn't allowed to write. But, despite the dangers, she decided to record her experience anyway.
