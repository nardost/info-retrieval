When Khalida Brohi found out that her cousin had died in a so-called honour killing in Pakistan, she was heartbroken. It inspired her campaign as a women's rights activist - firstly in her village and then all over the world. Luckily for Khalida and her endeavours, she has always had the unconventional support of her father who has done everything he can to encourage her independence. With a bowler hat, black eyeliner and a toothbrush moustache, Karim Asir is an uncanny Charlie Chaplin. He performs as the silent movie icon all over Afghanistan - in schools, orphanages, on stage and even in black and white films. However, it isn't just about the comedy for Karim, his performances come with a strong moral message. Protecting the embattled ocean is a tough job anywhere in the world, perhaps even more so in the coastal city of Lagos where piles of waste wash up on its shores every day. Doyinsola Igunye has been working hard to clean up Nigeria's beaches with the help of local children and she tells Outlook's Ijeoma Ndukwe how she's been saving sea turtles at the same time.
