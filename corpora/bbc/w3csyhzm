When Anoushka Shankar was young, she knew that the legendary Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar was an important figure in her family, but it was only when she was seven that she learned he was her father. The discovery would change Anoushka’s life – with Ravi as her teacher she mastered the instrument and began a career performing both with her father and as a virtuoso sitarist in her own right. When she was 16 she met another new member of her family - her half-sister and fellow music star Norah Jones, also Ravi’s daughter. Anoushka spoke to Emily Webb about the role her father played in her life, and the musical world he opened up for her.
