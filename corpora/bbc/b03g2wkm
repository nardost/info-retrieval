Professor Barbara Sahakian's book Bad Moves questions the ethics of smart drugs; they help treat brain injury and illness but should they be available to the healthy? Richard Bentall is the Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of Liverpool and author of Madness Explained and Doctoring the Mind. Guardian columnist and author Clare Allan drew on her experiences of being a psychiatric patient in her novel Poppy Shakespeare. The theme of this year's Free Thinking Festival is "Who's In Control?". Presenter Rana Mitter chairs this discussion looking at the neuroscience of depression, how it affects decision-making and the morality of medical treatments. Producer: Philippa Ritchie. Show less
