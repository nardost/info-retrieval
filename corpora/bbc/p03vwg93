South African businessman and surfer Brett Archibald has an extraordinary story of survival. In 2013 he fell overboard into the Indian Ocean at night. He then had to survive 28 hours, braving poisonous creatures..and seagulls! Brett's written a book about his experience called "Alone". Fatma and Mashal are twin baby girls from Pakistan's Swat Valley who were born joined together at the abdomen. Their father Nisar Ghani could not afford surgery to separate them but, with the help of paediatric surgeon Dr Amjad Choudhry, managed to find a potential lifeline for his daughters. There is no doubt that Jonathan is a survivor. He's made it to 182 years of age and is still going strong. He is not a human being of course, but a tortoise who's been looked after by English vet Joe Hollins, based on the remote island of St Helena in the South Atlantic. Joe explains why Jonathan is such a joy to care for. When the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in August 1945, Dr Akiko Mikamo's father Shinji was working on the roof of his house...just over a kilometre from the hypocentre of the bomb. Miraculously he somehow survived and has taught Akiko the importance of forgiveness. (L) Photo: Nisar Ghani with his twin daughters Fatma and Mashal. (R) Photo: Brett Archibald.
