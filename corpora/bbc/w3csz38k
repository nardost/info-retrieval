Stephanie Summerville tells us about her eye-opening experience as a casual worker. It was her first job and it thrust her into a shocking situation. She was providing respite care for a terminally-ill man in her hometown of Evansville, in Indiana. As she looked around his bedroom she saw a white robe and a hood with eyeholes cut out. Stephanie was a young black woman and this was the unmistakable uniform of the Ku Klux Klan. Presenter: Mariana Des Forges Producer: Deiniol Buxton Picture: Stephanie Summerville Credit: BBC Show less
