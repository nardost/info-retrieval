Presenter Dzifa Gbeho tours Accra with Chris Hesse, the then President's official photographer, who followed the Queen's every move during her first visit to Ghana in 1961. Dzifa asks why the Queen visited Ghana at this time when the country had only just gained independence. Who decides where and when the Queen travels abroad and who is in charge of organising the finer details of Royal visits? KB Asante, a retired Diplomat who witnessed the Queen's 1961 visit, shares his memories of meeting the Queen and discusses its impact. This first visit is contrasted with the Queen's second visit to Ghana in 1999. Dzifa talks to the former Minister of Education, Ekow Spio Garbrah who was present when the Queen gave an unusually politically-pointed speech to the Parliament in Accra during her 1999 visit.
