Prince Harry speaks candidly to journalist Bryony Gordon about dealing with his own mental health issues since his mother, Princess Diana, was killed in a car crash 20 years ago. The Prince reveals that he's only recently started getting professional help for his grief and why boxing and running help to keep him sane. Bryony Gordon works for the British newspaper The Telegraph and mental health is a subject close to her heart. She developed symptoms of obsessive compulsive order as a child and found it difficult to control her thoughts. Bryony tells us why it was so important for a member of the Royal Family to open up about his own emotional struggles so there can be an open conversation about mental health. Both Bryony and Prince Harry are trying to tackle the stigma surrounding mental health through the charity 'Heads Together'.
