Outlook is approaching its 50th anniversary, and today we hear from our fourth judge for Outlook Inspirations, the poet Lemn Sissay. Lemn was an official poet for the London 2012 Olympics and works to support new writers. Much of his own poetry focuses on his difficult upbringing. Lemn was brought up by a foster family, but when he was 18 he received his birth certificate and discovered his real name and identity. He tells his story and explains what inspiration means to him. There is a link to Outlook Inspirations below. Bobby McMullen is an extreme skier and mountain biker - who also happens to be blind. He has competed in many races and competitions including the 1998 Winter Paralympics. Bobby is one of our listener nominations for Outlook Inspirations. In the 1970s South African college teacher Sonny Venkatrathnam was a political prisoner on Robben Island. He was only allowed one book - Sonny chose The Complete Works of William Shakespeare. The book was secretly passed around the inmates, including Nelson Mandela. Master Aslam was working as a rickshaw driver in Karachi, Pakistan, when someone stopped on the street to film him singing. Earlier this month, the clip of his song went viral with almost one million hits. The 55-year-old reflects on his unexpected rise to fame. (Photo: Poet Lemn Sissay) Show less
