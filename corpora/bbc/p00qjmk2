Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, the Libyan artist who was persecuted by Gaddafi after painting an unflattering portrait. He tells how he joined the many street artists during the revolution who used spray cans to defy the regime. Also, the Brazilian favela nestling in a crater thought to have been carved out by a meteor. And from hunting whales to hunting the big beasts of the corporate world - the Native American woman who's defending the traditional way of life in Alaska. The exhibition Street Art: from the Victoria and Albert Museum, London and Libya is currently at the Dar Al Fagi Hassan Art Gallery in Tripoli, then travels to Benghazi on the 21 April 2012. Show less
