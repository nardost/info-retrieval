Nchimunya Mweeta is a Zambian footballer who's made headlines for the right and the wrong reasons. He's been playing professionally since he was 15, but when he moved to a Finnish club, he became embroiled in a scandal. He was approached by match fixers and offered money to throw games. He accepted, a decision that would end in disaster for him and his club. Nchimunya now fights corruption and bribery in sport with the support of the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports. He told Jo Fidgen his story, When she was 17 years old, Piera Aiello was forced to marry into a notorious Sicilian Mafia family. After witnessing the murder of her husband, she became a police informant. However, the decision meant that she had to go into hiding - giving up her name, her family, and wearing a veil when she went outside. Now, after 25 years, Piera has decided to show her face in public for the first time. She told Emily Webb her story. (Image: Nchimunya Mweeta. Photo credit: Kennedy Gondwe.) Show less
