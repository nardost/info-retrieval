Andrew Marr talks to the economist Will Hutton about the need to transform a country blighted by inequality and indebted to big finance. While Will Hutton argues for a fairer society, Lars Kroijer comes clean about the life and decisions of a hedge fund manager. Also arguing for greater fairness is Billy Ivory whose latest screenplay, Made In Dagenham, charts the walkout of the women workers at the Ford car plant who fought for equal pay in the 1960s. Women demonstrators form the backbone of Ronit Avni's new documentary film, which shows how one community organiser united both Palestinian and Israeli supporters to save his village from destruction by Israel's Separation Barrier.
