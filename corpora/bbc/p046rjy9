Nuzo Onoh is a writer of African Horror stories. She was raised in the Igbo culture of southern Nigeria, where most deaths are ascribed a supernatural cause and ghosts return to haunt the living. In the early 1990s Annette Herfkens was on a romantic holiday in Vietnam with her partner when their plane crashed into a mountainside. Annette was the sole survivor. While her family planned her funeral, she was battling for survival alone in the jungle. Jason Leach runs a business that presses the ashes of people who have been cremated into records that serve as a sonic memorial to their lives.
