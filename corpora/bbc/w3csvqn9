Bisi Alimi was the first Nigerian to come out as gay on national TV. It was in 2004 when he was working as an actor in Lagos and had just landed a role in a soap opera. He made his announcement on a morning talk show and after the revelation, Bisi lost his job, the TV show he appeared on was closed down, and he had to flee Nigeria. When Seme Khemisâ€™ mother died after giving birth to twins, he became determined to help other pregnant women. Seme is from South Sudan and ended up working in a medical clinic in Juba. He saved up to buy an ultrasound scanner to scan the pregnant women in his community. When the country was hit by war, he refused to leave his beloved ultrasound machine behind, and carried it on his head when he fled on foot to Uganda. Teenage racing driver Billy Monger lost both his legs in a horrific crash. Now, almost a year on he has surpassed medical expectations and is back behind the wheel, in training for an upcoming racing season. Image: Bisi Alimi Credit: Gorilla Arthouse Show less
