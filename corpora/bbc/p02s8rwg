Amol Sateh is a Dalit, the lowest of India's castes. Although born into a poverty, his mud-wrestling skills have helped him fight his way to a better life. Californian venture capitalist Chris Redlitz works with prisoners to encourage them to become tech-entrepreneurs. We also hear from Kenyatta Leala, a former prisoner whom he has helped. Abdul Qadir Timori is an Afghan archaeologist who is leading the excavation of ancient Buddhist relics buried in his homeland. The site of Mes Aynak has been damaged by fighters over many years and has now been bought by a Chinese company interested in its valuable copper deposits. South African blues guitarist Dan Patlansky has seven albums to his name but says it has been a real struggle to put the blues on the musical map of his country.
