As a child, Eunhee Kim was sexually abused by her coach at a tennis training camp in South Korea. She kept the extent of the abuse a secret for years. But when she was working as a tennis coach herself Eunhee bumped into him at a competition. She decided to go public and tell everyone what had happened to her. Tamino Moharam Fouad is a Belgian musician whose grandfather was known as 'the sound of the Nile'. When Tamino discovered his grandfather's original guitar in his old house in Cairo, he realised he could follow in his footsteps and take to the stage. Tamino is currently on tour in Europe and his debut album is called 'Amir.' And, what it's like to chase meteorites as they plummet from outer space and land around the world? Saskia Edwards meets Robert Ward and Mike Farmer to get an insight into the lives of two intrepid meteorite hunters and finds out where their space rock adventures have taken them.
