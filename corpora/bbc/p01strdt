Mirza Ali and Samina Baig from Pakistan are a brother and sister mountaineering team. They tell Jo Fidgen about their new challenge - to climb the highest peaks on seven continents. Also in the programme, Kelis is the R&B sensation with a string of best-selling hits, like Milkshake and Bounce. She tells the BBC's Jane Garvey about her new album and venture into the food business. Jamie McDonald has spent the past year running across Canada - from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific - 8,000 km, or the equivalent of 200 marathons. He's now completed his journey. And Nguyen Van Dung is a peach tree farmer whose orchard runs along the banks of the Red River in Hanoi. But when the river floods, bodies often wash up. Over the years Dung has pulled dozens of corpses from the river and he's created his own graveyard to honour the dead. Marianne Brown went to meet him. Show less
