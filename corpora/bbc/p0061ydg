Britain's Sex Trade A recent report by the British children's charity Barnardos has identified a worrying trend - the growth in networks of men seducing and then selling British girls for sex within the UK. Lucy Ash speaks to one young woman who was forced into prostitution when she was just thirteen. Although she is still in hiding from the gang who exploited her, she tells Lucy why she wants to make sure other girls don't face a similar fate.
