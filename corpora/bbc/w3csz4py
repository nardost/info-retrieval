In 1959 a group of nine Russian students met a mysterious death in the Ural Mountains. Experienced cross-country skiers, their bodies were found scattered around a campsite, their tent cut from the inside, as they seemingly panicked to escape from someone – or something. Sixty years on, Lucy Ash traces their footsteps to try and find out what happened. In the decades that have followed, a host of theories have been put forward as to what caused these mysterious deaths: it was an avalanche, or murderous local tribesman, or the Russian Yeti - or a secret Soviet weapons test. Though if there was a government cover-up, it’s curious that earlier this year the Russian authorities decided to reopen the investigation into the incident. They say it’s time to put the conspiracies to bed – but why now?
