In 2001 the Italian racing driver Alex Zanardi lost both his legs in a terrible crash. He nearly died on the way to hospital. But two years later, he was back on the track and later won two Gold medals as a hand cyclist at the 2012 Paralympics. Now he's racing sports cars again. Jang Jin Sung was the official poet of North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Ill, but in secret, he was composing highly critical poems. He eventually fled the country and recently published a memoir called Dear Leader. Munish Bansal has taken a photo of his daughter Suman every day of her life - and she's now 18 years old! We meet Munish and Suman, who tells us why she might just keep the tradition alive even after she's left home. Picture: Alex Zanardi Picture credit: BMW AG Show less
