Personal stories behind the news from all over the world. With Matthew Bannister. Widows in Nepal; racist tensions in Italy; Kano raps about education. Widows in Nepal After the ten year civil war in Nepal, thousands of women have been left widowed. Many face social exclusion and poverty, but they are now joining forces and organising support groups to look after each other. Joanna Jolly speaks to the founder of one such group in a town near the capital, Kathmandu. Italy's migrant workers under attack Last week saw violent clashes between migrant workers and locals in the southern Italian town of Rosarno. We speak to local priest Father Carmelo Ascone about the town's relationship with the migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, and the poor living conditions migrant workers endure. More Than One Way British rapper Kano tells Outlook how he's joining forces with the government to persuade young people to take a new educational qualification - a diploma aimed at 14 to 19 year olds that combines practical and academic learning. He's written a song to inspire them called "More Than One Way", which is already well on its way to becoming a hit. Show less
