Riyad Aljoboury is a primary school teacher from Iraq. Riyad spent most of his life under the rule of Saddam Hussein, he knew very little about the outside world and spoke no English. When American forces entered Iraq in 2003 they were the first westerners Riyad had ever met and they had a profound impact of his life. David Teie is a classically trained cellist and music researcher based at the University of Maryland.

He started with monkeys but it was his album "Music for Cats", that reached the top of the music charts and received the most attention.

Now, through a new online project, many of these women are getting their voices heard... Outlook's Jane Chambers reports from Lima. (Picture courtesy of Riyad Aljoboury) Show less
