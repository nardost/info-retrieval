It was two years ago that so-called Islamic State released a gruesome video, showing the beheading of an American journalist, James Foley, who had been abducted in Syria. A few months later, an old school friend of James', Brian Oakes, approached James' parents asking for permission to make a film about their son's life. They said yes, and it was released this year and has been nominated for the prestigious Emmy award. Australian ultra-marathon runner Dion Leonard struck up an unlikely friendship with a dog during a race in China. He called her Gobi and is now trying to bring her back to his home in Edinburgh. Rajitha Dissanayake is one of Sri Lanka's most political playwrights. Ever since he started writing at school - and right through Sri Lanka's 26-year civil war - Rajitha has criticised and satirised the government in a series of award-winning plays. He even targeted the national state broadcaster while he was working for them. Outlook's Nicki Paxman went to meet him in Colombo to find out how he has done it - and got away with it.
