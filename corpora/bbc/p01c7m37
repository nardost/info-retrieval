Donovan Bailey broke the 100 metres world record for Canada at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Matthew hears his story from stockbroker to world class athlete. The Syrian conflict has brought the country's healthcare system to a state of collapse. Neighbouring Israel has made it clear that it won't allow Syrian refugees into its territory but some doctors are treating injured Syrians who make it into the country, including Dr Amram Hadari from the Ziv Medical Centre. Lucian Msamati has been acting for most of his life. He began his career in Zimbabwe, but moved to the UK, taking on roles from the National Theatre to the global hit TV series Game of Thrones. He tells Matthew about his latest production for Tiata Fahodzi company. When Nigel Holland turned 50 he set himself a list of 50 things to do - anything from indoor sky-diving to completing a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle. But all 50 were made more challenging by the fact that Nigel has a degenerative disease called CMT (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), which has left him a wheelchair user. His daughter also has the condition and is working on her own list. Show less
