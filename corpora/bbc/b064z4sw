Vicky Pryce, the Greek born economist who attracted media headlines on her conviction for perverting the course of justice over speeding points incurred by her former husband, Chris Huhne, nominates Melina Mercouri as a great life at a time when Greece is facing huge economic and political pressures. The film star who achieved global fame became a much loved politician in her homeland. As Minister for Culture, she promoted Greece's cultural heritage and fought for the return of the Elgin Marbles. Some consider one her greatest achievements to be the founding of the European Capital of Culture; culture being in her eyes something as important as politics or money, if not more so.
