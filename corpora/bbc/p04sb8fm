Tricia Seaman was looking after cancer patients at a hospital in the town of Harrisburg in the American state of Pennsylvania. One day, an encounter with a terminally ill patient changed her life forever. She tells Matthew what happened. When Iranian pianist Ramin Bahrami heard a piece of music by the composer JS Bach at the age of five his life was transformed. This passion that developed, led him from his birth country to Italy, where he built a reputation as one of the most innovative interpreters of Bach's work. British historian Tasha Marks has been recreating the love foods of the past. She creates installations and events for museums and galleries around the world, like aromatic paintings that tell the history of spices, or Biblically-inspired sweets infused with gold, frankincense and myrrh. Outlook goes to meet Tasha at a Valentine's Day lecture in London, themed around the history of aphrodisiacs. Image: (L) Tricia Seamen with (R) Trisha. Credit: Tadpole Photography. Show less
