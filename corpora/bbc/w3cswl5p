In 1994, 13-year-old Nicholas Barclay went missing in Texas. Several years later, he apparently resurfaced in Spain, and he was reunited with his family. But all was not as it seemed. Private investigator Charlie Parker knew he had an imposter on his hands. John grew up in a Protestant stronghold throughout the Troubles in Belfast, Northern Ireland. When his father died, he found out that his mother wasn't dead like he’d been led to believe. She was alive and Catholic – a religion he was brought up to despise.
