We hear from a district mayor in the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir in eastern Turkey. Abdullah Demirbas describes how the conflict between the Kurdish minority and the Turkish state has affected him as a politician and a father. Also, Matthew Bannister talks to Habiba Amiri in the Afghan province of Bamiyan. She runs COAM, the Conservation Organisation for the Afghan Mountains - an unusual role for a young Afghan woman.
