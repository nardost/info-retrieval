What next for Egypt? The army has appointed a new government after protests against the democratically-elected Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi. For the second time in two years, the Arab world’s most populous country is in what the army calls a ‘transition period’. But what has brought Egypt back to the point where the second president has now been toppled within just two years? Earlier this year, Shaimaa Khalil - who was born in Egypt - travelled across the country, documenting how ordinary people were adapting to life after the Arab Spring, for a series called Egypt’s Challenge. She’s back in Egypt to present a special programme reflecting on the growing concerns among those she met on that trip. She brings those concerns up-to-date within the context of this week’s events. She is joined by a panel of guests in her home town of Alexandria. (Picture: Egyptian anti-regime protesters hold a banner saying 'Get Out Morsi', Credit: AFP/Getty Images) Show less
