Cleve Jones, a leading gay rights campaigner in the USA, talks to Matthew Bannister about how he became a friend of the country's first openly gay elected official Harvey Milk - and arrived on the scene minutes after he was shot dead. In the 1980s, Cleve nearly died of AIDS - and campaigned for better treatment for other sufferers. Most recently he's been one of the most powerful advocates for equal marriage rights for gay people. Spanish photojournalist Juan Torre began to suffer from Behcet's syndrome - a rare disease that left him almost totally blind by the age of 30. Despite being unable to make out more than shapes and colours, Juan didn't give up photography altogether. He talks about how he adapted his techniques and came up with an idea to help blind people explore his photos through touch. At 95 years old, Olga Kotelko, from Canada, travels the world competing in track and field events. Since taking up athletics at the age of 77, she has won over 750 gold medals and holds over 30 world records.
