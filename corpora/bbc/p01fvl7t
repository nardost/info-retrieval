Shaimaa Khalil looks at the Arab Spring through the eyes of prominent writers whose countries have undergone major change over the past two-and-a-half years. She hears how much has really changed for the masses who rose up against their leaders. Have their hopes been fulfilled? Or have they faded with the challenge of democracy and restructuring? Our guests on the programme are Egyptian Writer Sara Khorshid, Libyan author Ghazi Gheblawi, Tunisia's Samar Samir Mezghanni, Farea Al-Muslimi from Yemen and Syrian author Samar Yazbek.
