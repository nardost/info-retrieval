When Islamist gunmen stormed a Jewish supermarket in Paris last year, Malian shop assistant Lassana Bathily acted to save several shoppers by hiding them in a walk-in fridge. He was later hailed as a hero, and awarded French citizenship by the president. Chilean Adolfo Torres is a chef and an artist who does not really see a difference between the two. He makes art with food, and travels the world with his communal cooking pot encouraging people to cook together as a kind of artistic enterprise. Anthony Crolla, from the north of England, was thrilled when he got the chance to fight for the boxing world title last year. But just a few weeks before the fight was due to take place he was attacked as he tried to prevent a burglary and suffered a fractured skull. Dias the cat was separated from his owners on the Greek island of Lesbos. They had arrived by boat after fleeing Iraq but could not find him after he got scared and ran away. The American volunteer Amy Schrodes then found Dias and set out on an extraordinary journey to reunite him with family. (Photo: Lassana Bathily. Credit: Francois Guillot/AFP/Getty Images) Show less
