Rob Gore is an African-American doctor in Brooklyn. Traumatised by seeing young black men coming in with gunshot wounds, he decided that he needed to stop the gun violence at the source. When Sepideh Hooshyar's father died during her childhood, she suddenly found solace in the night sky. Her conservative family weren't that happy about her late evening excursions but Sepideh wouldn't be deterred. Ten years later, and with a young family of her own, she's encouraging others to reach for the stars and follow their dreams. Ugandan Susan Kigula was a young mother when she was sentenced to hang for murder. She always maintained her innocence and sang songs of sorrow in a choir she formed with her fellow inmates on death row. Behind bars Susan also started a school and completed a law degree, but it's what she did next which would change the lives of more than 400 other inmates, as well as the law of the land.
