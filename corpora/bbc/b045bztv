Last Broadcast Date: Thu 5 Jun 2014
What is the future of arts broadcasting? What does it mean to explore art through the prism of a landmark series? In an increasingly diverse broadcasting landscape what could a new version of a programme such as Civilization say about the role of the Arts now? Philip Dodd chairs a debate about arts broadcasting, past and present. His panel is Dr Janina Ramirez and Dr Gus Casely-Hayford, both of whom combine art history with broadcasting careers, Charles Uzzell-Edwards who creates his graffiti artworks and runs the Pure Evil Gallery and Kim Evans, award winning film maker and former head of Music and Arts at the BBC. Producer: Zahid Warley. Show less
