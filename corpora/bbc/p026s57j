American journalist Cara Anna thought she had landed her dream job when she became a foreign correspondent in China. But the stress led to mental health problems, and she eventually attempted suicide twice. She now campaigns to support others in her position. Clarence Adoo was working as a professional trumpet player in the north of England in 1995, when a car accident left him paralysed from the neck down. He now performs using a tailor-made instrument called Headspace. Laurens de Groot gave up a career as a policeman in the Netherlands in order to become an anti-whaling activist. He now confronts Japanese whalers at sea. Mahsa and Marjan Vahdat are sisters from Iran who found fame singing traditional Persian melodies - despite the restrictions on women singing in public.
