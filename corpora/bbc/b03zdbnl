Anne McElvoy looks at the impact of war, the Afghan elections and childhood violence. She's joined by Professor Hew Strachan, author of 'The Direction of War - Contemporary Strategy in Historical Perspective,' and Ian Morris, author of 'War, What is it Good For? The Role of Conflict in Civilisation from Primates to Robots.' Film critic Charlotte O Sullivan has been watching 'I Declare War,' Jason Lapeyre and Robert Wilson's film about childhood games which turn sour. And thirteen years after British troops entered combat in Afghanistan, and in the week that the British Command handed over to the Americans in Helmand province, Noorjahan Akbar and Hamdullah Mohib talk about what has happened to their culture and society in Afghanistan over that time and what might change with national elections at the week-end.
