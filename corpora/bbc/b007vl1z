COMMODIFICATION OF WATER Recent research by Bronwen Morgan, Professor of Socio-legal Studies Faculty of Social Sciences and Law, University of Bristol, raises vital political and economic questions about the extent to which water is a commercial product like any other commercial product – a bottle of coke or a can of beans – or a basic human right. Professor Morgan’s study explores the ways in which provision of water has developed into a highly contested terrain about its meaning and use; taking in forms of social protest, to notion of rights, and governance. JOB SATISFACTION Why are hairdressers the second most contented people in the UK workforce, after highly paid managers? Why have teachers moved up from being the most unhappy workers in the country to being near the top of the occupational satisfaction charts? Laurie Taylor hears the details of a new analysis of which workers in Britain are happy and which jobs lead to very low satisfaction. Does happiness really affect productivity? What is the most important factor that leads to fulfilment at work? Laurie is joined by Michael Rose, Professor of Social and Policy Science at the Bath University who has compiled an index of workplace satisfaction, based upon his analysis of latest information from a government workplace study and Richard Reeves author of Happy Mondays - putting the pleasure back into work, which calls for revolutionary re-evaluation of modern working life.
