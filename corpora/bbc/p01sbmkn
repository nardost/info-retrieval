It is easy to be hoodwinked into thinking the world you immediately see and experience is the most important part of reality. So this week you are invited to join us in leaving Earth and zooming up into space to discover what we can see when we are thousands of miles away. Joining Bridget Kendall for this journey are space archaeologist Sarah Parcak, artist Mishka Henner, and cosmologist Max Tegmark.
