Viruses: both lethal vectors that can sow death and destruction, and clever adaptable mechanisms that could transform the future of manufacturing. And should we worry more about the viral spread of ideas and trends? Bridget Kendall's guests are the Director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Peter Piot, who is the co-discoverer of the Ebola virus; bioengineer professor Angela Belcher, who uses viruses to make novel materials at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and psychologist Dr. Susan Blackmore, who has a special interest in the viral potential of digital technology.
