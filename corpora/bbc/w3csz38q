Jacke Van Woerkom is rebuilding her life after a horrific event in her family. The experience has also changed the way she looks at the parents of murderers. Surrounding herself with women who have gone through a deep trauma has helped her recover emotionally from the fact that her son attempted to kill his wife and children and then took his own life. Jacke talks honestly about this devastating experience. Jacke has written a book called: Grieving moms, finding hope: resurfacing.
