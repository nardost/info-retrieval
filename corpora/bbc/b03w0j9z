Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld talk to Anne McElvoy about the impact of education, culture and religion on success. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother was a parenting memoir which brought Amy Chua criticism and even death threats from people objecting to her disciplinarian attitude to motherhood. Her new book, written with her husband, is called The Triple Package: What Really Determines Success. Versailles, Peter Gill's new play at the Donmar Theatre in London takes its inspiration from the peace negotiations at the end of the First World War. We have a first night review. Producer: Neil Trevithick. Show less
