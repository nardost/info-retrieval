Ruba Ahmed's daughter Abinta was one of 20 hostages killed during the 2016 siege at the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It was the worst terror attack in the country's history. Before her death, Abinta had wanted to create a school for underprivileged children, and to build a children's home next to an old people's home so young and old could enjoy each other's company. Ruba Ahmed has set up a foundation in Abinta's name to honour her daughter's last wishes. Outlook's Candida Beveridge went to meet her. Sharon Greenleaf La Pierre is a former professor from Boulder, Colorado in the US. She was out riding her horse Esplendor when they were attacked by a wild stallion. They both managed to escape - thanks to Sharon's operatic singing. She tells Outlook what happened. Claudio Yanez is a senior manager in the public health service in Chile. He has a successful career but his childhood was exceptionally difficult. He was raised in various orphanages and child care homes, and says he witnessed physical and emotional abuse. The Chilean government is investigating a number of these centres, and Claudio has finally decided to speak out about his past. He tells Jo Fidgen his story. Nisha Dupuis is a 19-year-old radio presenter from the tiny Caribbean island of Anguilla. Last week, she kept broadcasting live on the air during the height of Hurricane Irma. She tells us about the drama, and the aftermath. (Picture: Ruba Ahmed next to a painting of her daughter. Credit: Candida Beveridge.) Show less
