A new history of ideas presented by Melvyn Bragg but told in many voices. An opportunity to hear all this week's programmes in this Omnibus edition. Melvyn is joined by four guests with different backgrounds to discuss a really big question. This week he's asking 'What is Love?' Helping him answer it are the theologian Giles Fraser, writer Lisa Appignanesi, classicist Edith Hall and psychotherapist Mark Vernon. Across the week Giles, Lisa, Edith and Mark took us further into the history of ideas about love, with programmes of their own. Between them they examined Freud's ideas on erotic love, Jesus and altruism, the first guidance on how to be a loving parent, by Rousseau and Aristophanes' speech which explains how love was born. This omnibus edition has all five programmes together. Show less
