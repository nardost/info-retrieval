Fab Morvan became world famous with the 80s pop band Milli Vanilli. He and his bandmate Rob Pilatus notched up number one hits in Europe and America, and sold millions of albums. But they had a secret - and when that secret came out, it had a devastating effect. Craig Lloyd from Utah is an ultra runner who runs hundreds of miles regularly on mountain trails...the perfect habitat for a particularly elusive animal - the wolverine. Similar to badgers, and highly solitary, wolverines are incredibly hard to spot and study. Craig's running skills, combined with his zoology degree, became invaluable in helping scientists prove that the wolverine hadn't become extinct. The city of SÃ£o Luis has become known as the "Brazilian Jamaica" because of its love of reggae. It's now 50 years since reggae arrived there, and to mark the occasion, a new reggae museum has opened. Our reporter Gibby Zobel went to meet the famous Brazilian reggae singer Celia Sampaio and the museum's director Ademar Danilo.
