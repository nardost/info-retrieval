Ron Davis's son was killed in a case that made headlines around the world. 17-year old black teenager, Jordan Davis, had been shot by a 45-year-old white man, Michael Dunn, in a dispute that started over loud music. Dunn had pulled up next to the car in which the teenager was sitting with three friends, and asked them to turn the music down. Jordan reacted angrily, and Dunn fired ten shots into the car. It became known as the 'loud music trial'. The case rested on whether Dunn had committed cold-blooded murder, or had acted in self-defence. The state of Florida has a statute known as 'Stand Your Ground', that says it is permitted to defend yourself, with no duty to retreat, if you believe your life to be threatened. According to polls it's a law that has much popular support across America. Dunn was convicted of murder, although he has now filed an appeal against his conviction. A documentary film which followed the case from the beginning was screened in the States this summer, including at the White House - and there's an ongoing debate about the issues raised by the case.
