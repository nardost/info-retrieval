Many Filipina women working overseas have left children behind and now watch their children grow up over a screen, but does this virtual mothering help maintain their relationship while they spend years apart? Filipina migrant workers in the UK and their children back in the Philippines tell their stories. Migrant mothers are desperate for ways to make their presence felt as something more than a "money angel" who magically wires money home every month but how do their now grown up children feel about their decision to work oversees.
