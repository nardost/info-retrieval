Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Five years ago, the exiled Russian dissident and former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned with a radioactive substance after meeting two Russian contacts at a hotel bar in London. He died 23 days later. On Outlook today we hear from Alexander's widow Marina. She has recently won the right to a full inquest in a British court, and she is campaigning tirelessly for the truth to be known about her husband's death. Photo: Press Association Show less
