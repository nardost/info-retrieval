Karma is a fundamental part of many eastern based religions including Hinduism and Buddhism. It is commonly interpreted as action. Those who believe in it say their past actions influence their life today and their future actions will have positive or negative repercussions in this life or the next. What impact does this belief have on individuals and communities? Does it encourage fatalism or is it a guide to improving your life? And does collective karma exist? The programme talks to an Indian guru Swarmi Sukhabodhananda, buddhist agnostic Stephen Batchelor, scientist Jim al-Khalili, associate professor of religious studies Elizabeth Harris and journalists Mark Tully and Mary Finnigan.
