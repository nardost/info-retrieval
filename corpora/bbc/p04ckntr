Every year thousands of girls and young women are trafficked from Nepal to work in the sex trade, mainly in neighbouring India. The country has long been a target for traffickers - but one woman is risking her life to stop them. Sixty-seven-year-old Anuradha Koirala is the founder of Maiti Nepal. The charity has rescued 30,000 women and girls, helped to convict 1200 traffickers, and runs refuges for women who have escaped the sex trade. Iain Clark and Helen Jansen want to turn the small farming town of Oamaru in New Zealand into the capital of the Steampunk movement. Steampunk is based on imagining technology the Victorians might have created - using steam power and iron machinery - and giving it a modern twist. Nati Canada is the most successful portrait artist in Spain. She has painted Hollywood film stars, Popes and members of the Spanish royal family - but the portrait that got her the most international recognition was the one she made of Michael Jackson. It was the only time he ever sat for any artist. Robert Bezeau, who lives in Panama, has built a house with over a million discarded plastic bottles and is now creating a whole village including a castle.
