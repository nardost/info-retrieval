Joanne Yirrell is a teacher from Bedfordshire in the south of England. Her son Harry died of malaria eight years ago, after a trip to work as a volunteer in Ghana. Joanne now works to eradicate malaria - her story being the real-life inspiration behind the film Mary and Martha, starring Hollywood actress Hilary Swank. Albina du Boisrouvray was working as a journalist and film producer when her son Francois-Xavier Bagnoud died in a helicopter crash in 1986. She comes from a wealthy background and decided to auction off a large chunk of her assets. With the money she raised she started FXB International, a charity that today is active in many countries around the world, particularly working to help children affected by AIDS/HIV. Also Lieutenant Commander Abhilash Tomy tells us about the 150 day voyage which made him the first Indian to sail solo and non-stop around the world. And Omara "Bombino" Moctar, the Touareg guitarist who's updated his people's tradition of protest music.
