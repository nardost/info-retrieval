Katy Morgan-Davies spent her entire life living as a virtual prisoner. She'd been born into a Maoist cult, ruled over by a domineering leader called Aravindan Balakrishnan, also known as AB or Comrade Bala. They'd lived not in some remote compound, but in the densely-packed streets of south London. After 30 years of life in the cult, Katy was able to devise her escape. Swede Olle Strandberg broke his neck doing an acrobatic jump. Ten years later he reattempted the jump. But this time he did it suspended high in the sky by a hot air balloon. There's a workshop in Naples, Italy, which is known for its umbrellas. Four generations of one family have poured their hearts into hand-crafting them. Outlook's Alessia Cerantola went to meet the Talaricos. Image: Katy Morgan-Davies Credit: BBC/Perry Images Show less
