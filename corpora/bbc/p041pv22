At the age of 14, Collin Smith was involved in a car accident that left him quadriplegic, without the use of his arms or legs. When 64-year-old Ernest Greene heard what had happened, he decided he wanted to help Collin. They went on to become an unlikely duo. Hiroki Terai believes Japanese people are not very good at expressing their emotions. He's therefore on a mission to make them cry. He runs a business that allows people to hire a handsome man to play them sad video clips and wipe away their tears. Reginald Dwayne Betts was sent to jail aged just 16 for his part in a carjacking. However, after serving his sentence he went on to become a published poet and has just graduated from Yale Law School. Dr. Nabil-Iosif Morad is from the Syrian city of Homs but, in his current role as a town mayor in Greece, he is housing refugees in an abandoned tourist resort. Jessi Calzado-Esponda was just 6 when she was accidentally separated from her family in Cuba and placed in a makeshift raft making the dangerous journey to the United States. Thousands of others attempted to cross the Caribbean sea from the Communist island to the shores of Florida, but Jessi was perhaps the only one who did it by accident.
