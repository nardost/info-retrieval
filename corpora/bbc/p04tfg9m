On 13 March, 1964, Kitty Genovese was murdered in Queens, in New York. Kitty was attacked in the early hours of the morning outside her apartment block. It was reported at the time that dozens of neighbours had witnessed that attack but had done nothing to help, and her story led to the identification of a new sociological theory, the bystander effect. Kitty's brother, Bill Genovese, was sixteen back then. He set out to find out what actually happened that night. The documentary about the case is called The Witness. Self-taught musician Lucho Quequezana is one of Peru's most important musicians and composers. He can play 25 different musical instruments and one of his albums even beat One Direction and Justin Beiber to become the best-selling CD in Peru for two years in a row. Moonlight writer Tarell Alvin McCraney started out life in the slums of Miami. His mother was addicted to crack and died of an Aids-related illness, and his stepfather was killed by drug dealers. To add to that Tarell was gay and growing up in a neighbourhood where that was potentially dangerous. Back in 2011, Tarell told us about his extraordinary childhood. Director of Mexico City's Dog and Animal Hospital Silvia Viruega is at the top of her profession, but it was overcoming tragedy that led her there. She's the solo survivor of a plane crash and it was her Yorkshire Terrier, Gary, who saved her from depression. (Picture: Kitty Genovese. Photo credit: The Witness.) Show less
