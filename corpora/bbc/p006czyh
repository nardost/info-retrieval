Born up a tree Carolina Pedro became world-famous during Mozambique's disastrous floods ten years ago. She gave birth up a tree, where she'd taken refuge with other members of her family, and the news picture of her became the defining image of the flood. Baby Rosita, now celebrating her tenth birthday, talks to Outlook, along with Carolina. 21st century Buddhism in Japan We hear about the ways Japanese Buddhist monks are reaching out to young people to make the religion more attractive. Roland Buerk meets a monk who has turned his hand to rap, and goes online to visit a virtual temple. James Cook After a childhood in Jamaica, James Cook and his family made a new life in London. He tells us how he became a European boxing champion, and now works with young people in the deprived borough of Hackney. He lives near the site of the London Olympics, and he says his hopes of big benefits for local people have been disappointed. Show less
