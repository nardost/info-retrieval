Mental Health in Kashmir The violent struggle for control of Indian administered Kashmir has left psychological scars on local people living with fear, insecurity and loss. There are only 20 psychiatrists and a handful of clinical psychologists for a population of four million. Srinagar-based psychiatrist Dr Arshad Hussain describes life for him and his patients. The Man in White Over the last 17 years, a man dressed in white has become a familiar figure on the streets of Cameroon's economic capital, Douala. Dieudonne Nkoum, nicknamed "L'homme en blanc" or the Man in White, has taken it on himself to repair potholes and fix blocked drains, all without getting paid. The BBC's Francis Ngwa Niba went to meet him.

Christian tells us about the pleasures, and risks, of Kabul life. Show less
