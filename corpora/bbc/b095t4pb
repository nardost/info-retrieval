Sectarianisation - Laurie Taylor asks if a new theory offers an explanation for contemporary conflicts across the Arab Islamic world. Have we become too wedded to a version of events which suggests that Shia and Sunni peoples are locked into a primordial, trans-historical battle, seemingly without end? He's joined by Danny Postel, Assistant Director of the Middle East and North African Studies Program at Northwestern University, Madawi Al-Rasheed, Visiting Professor at the Middle East Centre at the LSE and Patrick Cockburn, Middle East correspondent for the The Independent.
