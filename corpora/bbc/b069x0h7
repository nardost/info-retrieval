Stop & Search: Laurie Taylor explores a police practice which is seen as a vital tool against crime by law enforcers, but has been dogged by controversy. He's joined by Michael Shiner, Associate Professor of Social Policy at the LSE, and editor of a new collection of research which assesses the use & misuse of the tactic. How did it arise and what is its future? Also, Suzanne Moffatt, Senior Lecturer at Newcastle University, discusses her study into a group of cancer patients experience of current welfare reforms. Producer: Jayne Egerton. Show less
