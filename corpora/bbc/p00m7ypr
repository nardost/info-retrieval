Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today on Outlook, Boy George talks about his extraordinary career as a singer songwriter. Known for his flamboyant dress sense and his colourful dreadlocks, his band Culture Club were a vivid splash of colour on the early 1980s music scene but it was his androgynous image that really caught the popular imagination. After early success with Culture Club, he battled with a destructive drug habit and even ended up spending time in prison. He turned 50 this year and to celebrate he's written a book about his life, called King of Queens. (Image: Boy George. Credit: Getty Images) Show less
