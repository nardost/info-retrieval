What makes people push themselves to the limit in sport and dice with death? We sometimes call such people ‘adrenaline junkies’ but, as Harvard Professor of Medicine Brian Hoffman explains, adrenaline itself has little to do with it. Presenter Matthew Taylor is also joined by: former Olympic athlete and now Professor of Sports Medicine, Greg Whyte, who now helps celebrities achieve feats of endurance, such as running 43 marathons in 51 days; and by writer and broadcaster Jennifer Jordan, who focuses on Himalayan women mountaineers and the reasons some of them eagerly climb to the ‘death zone’ above 8,000 meters.
