While husband and wife Timofey Yuriev and Melissa Kho were walking their dog, Kira, in New York state, they came across two dogs that had fallen through the ice into a freezing lake. Timofey immediately stripped off and jumped in. Why did he think he could save the dogs? Well Timofey had spent his childhood caring for animals injured in nuclear blasts, he'd also been dunked in frozen lakes by his grandfather. So perhaps Timofey was the perfect person to carry out the rescue. Priest Jos√© Maria Di Paola tries to help drug addicts in the slums of Buenos Aires, Argentina. But his efforts have led to him receiving death threats from drug gangs, as reporter Colm Flynn found out. In 2013 Britain's National Health Service, the NHS, was getting a lot of bad press, and morale among staff was low. Molly Case was studying nursing at the time and wrote a poem that was a passionate defence of what nurses do. She was invited to perform it at the annual nursing conference and it became a rallying cry throughout the profession. After Molly graduated she went to work on the heart, chest and lungs ward. One day a very unexpected patient arrived. (Photo credit: Melissa Kho.) Show less
