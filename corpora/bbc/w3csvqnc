The turn of the millennium was the golden age of Boy Bands and leading the genre was British Norwegian pop group, a1. But what's it like to be a teen heart-throb, with tens of thousands of girls across the world professing their undying love for you? Former a1 singer Ben Adams talks to Matthew Bannister about his experience as a pop idol. Orla Doherty loves the ocean. So what better job could she have than working as a producer on the BBC's blockbuster natural history programme Blue Planet 2. The show - and Orla - went to extraordinary lengths to capture the beauty of life deep below the sea. Mike Solomonov is an award-winning American chef who has built up a chain of restaurants all serving food based on Middle Eastern cuisine. He was born in Israel but brought up in the USA and draws on his Israeli roots when he creates his recipes. Mike's journey to the top has not been an easy one as he struggled to fight addictions and money problems. Image: Boy band a1 with Ben Adams (RHS). Credit: Sony Music Show less
