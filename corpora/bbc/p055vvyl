British politics has become unpredictable. As voters were going to the polls in the UK general election on 8 June, many were contemplating a landslide for the Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May â€“ nearly all polls predicted it. And with an apparently unpopular leader in Jeremy Corbyn, that could mean many Labour members of Parliament would lose their seat. One of them, Lindsay Hoyle, MP for Chorley in Lancashire, had been elected 20 years ago, and was the deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. And of course Theresa May and the Conservative Party did win - but they are the largest party in what is a hung parliament - they no longer have overall control, so what happened? Why did people vote the way they did? And what does it say about Britain, Brexit, security and the different generations. We picked one constituency at random - Chorley in Lancashire - 250km from London. What they told us before, during and after Election Day might not hold for all seats everywhere, but it might provide a clue.
