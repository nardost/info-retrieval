As the BBC bids farewell to Bush House, home to the World Service for more than 70 years, this special programme charts the relationship between this iconic building and the broadcasts produced there. Originally designed for an Anglo-American trading company, Bush House has been a London landmark for generations and a place of pilgrimage for radio fans from across the globe. But few people know that this is the building that once saw a duel between staff of its language services or that this was the first part of the BBC to serve "proper" coffee. Join BBC historian Jean Seaton and architect Mark Hines as they enter Bush House under the impressive portico dedicated "To the Friendship of English Speaking Peoples" and take an audio journey through the corridors and stairwells, eavesdropping on some of the sounds and memories from key moments in the history of both the BBC World Service and of this very special building.
