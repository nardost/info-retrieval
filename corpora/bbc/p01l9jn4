Could this tiny, crowded, enclave of free capitalism become a model for cities on the Chinese mainland? And does Hong Kong's political and geographical situation make it feel insular or outward looking? These are some of the issues being debated in this week's Forum from the City University, which is part of the Hong Kong International Literary Festival. Bridget Kendall talks to four prominent local residents: writer Xu Xi, photographer Palani Mohan, Americanist Peter Swirski and Hong Kong Arts Festival director Tisa Ho. (Photo: Hong Kong skyline.
