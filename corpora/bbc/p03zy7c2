'Maha' is a Syrian woman who says her husband poured petrol on her and set her alight. She adds that women in the country are being subjected to much more extreme domestic violence than before the conflict began. Jumping from the beautiful 450-year-old Mostar Bridge in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been a rite of passage for young men for centuries. It was a historic landmark before it was destroyed during the conflict of the 1990s and has since been rebuilt. Some have died in the attempt, but for the legendary diver Emir Balic it has been a life's work. Dorothy Bohm is an acclaimed street photographer. She was born in 1924 in what was then East Prussia on the Baltic Coast. At the age of fourteen her parents sent her alone by train to England to escape the Nazis. Dorothy arrived in London carrying a parting gift of a camera from her father that was to shape her life and career. (Photo: Rubble covers the street of Aleppo, 11 June, 2014.
