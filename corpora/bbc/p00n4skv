Extraordinary personal stories from around the world: today, the story of Samira Ibrahim, an Egyptian woman who says she was subjected to a forced virginity test by the country's military after taking part in the Tahrir Square protests in March 2011. Samira took legal action and in December a court in Cairo ruled that forced virginity testing of detainees was illegal and must stop. Samira tells Matthew Bannister about her fight for justice. Also Hakim Nsubuga, a former gang member who was raised in one of London's Olympic boroughs, looks ahead to the forthcoming Games. And we meet Hannibal Hellmurto, a German tax official who became a sword swallower. He tells Matthew Bannister how he seriously injured himself while swallowing a neon light tube. Show less
