Anne McElvoy and composer Neil Brand with a first night review of High Society at the Old Vic directed by Maria Freedman. Xinran talks about her new book Buy Me The Sky which explores the consequences of the one-child policy which China began to pursue in 1979. As the first generation of only children grow up and become parents in their turn, she set out to tell their stories. She is in discussion with journalist Isabel Hilton. And a week on from the election, Anne turns to three historians - Tim Bale, Krista Cowman and Jon Lawrence - to offer their views on the dramatic changes to the UK's political landscape. High Society is at London's Old Vic Theatre until August 22nd 2015. Producer: Torquil MacLeod (Image: Ellie Bamber and Jamie Parker in The Old Vic production of High Society.
