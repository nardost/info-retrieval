Khaled Naanaa was working as a nurse in a government controlled hospital in Damascus when protests started in 2011. Khaled did not want to be involved in these protests until he witnessed the violence with his own eyes. He made the decision to leave his wife and three week old daughter behind and join the revolution working in field hospitals, treating the wounded and using online videos to perform life saving surgery. In 2015 the area Khaled was working in was put under siege and the 40,000 inhabitants began to starve. Khaled started filming the starving people and his videos were sent around the world. Josh Hanagarne is a librarian at the Salt Lake City Public Library in Utah. He has been working there for ten years managing the collection, helping people with their requests, and occasionally doing some obligatory 'shushing'. However, staying quiet can be difficult for Josh himself, because he has Tourette's syndrome. The Aschiana school in Kabul, Afghanistan is a place where boys and girls who work on the streets can come and learn. The school means a lot to Hashmatullah Hayat who learnt to paint there during Taliban rule. This skill changed his life and he started to sell his paintings to military and embassy staff using the money to save up and eventually go to university in India. (Picture: Khaled Naanaa.
