On Start the Week, Andrew Marr talks to Australia's foremost poet, Les Murray, on the joy of etymology and the diversity of Australia's language, and why he's fighting to keep the 'Pobbledonk' and 'rippy' from extinction. Dr Sandy Knapp is also fighting to preserve the diversity of plants, and she talks about the thrill of finding new species and the conventions of naming. The theatre director Elen Bowman is reviving John Osborne's 'The Devil Inside Him', a play that was first performed half a century ago, lost, and only recently recovered in a box in the Lord Chamberlain's Office. And the political journalist Colin Brown, fresh from the election, takes us on a trip round Whitehall, from the time of Henry VIII to today. Producer: Katy Hickman. Show less
