Nnedi Okorafor is a Nigerian American writer of a genre of books called Afrofuturism, which combine science fiction with African mythology. Nnedi wrote the comic Black Panther: Long Live the King and is now working on a spin-off based on the superhero's sisterâ€™s character, Shuri. But becoming a writer was not the most straightforward journey for Nnedi. She was set to become a tennis player and a track athlete, when a surgery to her spine left her temporarily paralysed. While she was in hospital she found solace in writing. Imagine a surf board flying at 75km per hour at 600 metres up in the air. Would you try to ride it? Anicet Leone did exactly that. He's a member of the Flying Frenchies, a group of French daredevils who combine mountaineering, BASE jumping and circus skills to create unique performances and push the boundaries of extreme sports. He's been telling Emily Webb where his passion for stunts came from. Every day, millions of people walk the streets of London, completely unaware of the treasures hidden underneath. The British capital was built on the remains of previous cities, and the relics of ancient civilisations are still trapped under layers of soil and tarmac. Sadie Watson from the Museum of London Archaeology is on a mission to uncover them. (Image: Nnedi Okorafor standing next to the comics character Black Panther. Photo credit: Anyaugo Okorafor.)
