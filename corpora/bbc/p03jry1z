An investigation into the robots of tomorrow. The programme looks at the work of the robots that are designed to work with people rather than as precision engineers, thus requiring some personality. For example, Nursebot Pearl assists older people with simple tasks in the home. Producers: Roland Pease and Andrew Luck-Baker. Picture: Robot hand and human hand, Credit: Thinkstock Show less
