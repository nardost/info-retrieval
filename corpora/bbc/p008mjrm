Letter in a Bottle In 2002 a bright blue tear-shaped bottle washed up on a beach in the south of England. The bottle contained a letter written in French - a farewell message to a thirteen year old boy called Maurice who had died. The woman who found the bottle sent it to the writer Karen Liebreich, who was so moved by the letter that she spent seven years trying to find out who had written it and why. Her book The Letter in the Bottle is out now. What your Dad means to you More of your letters about the father figure in your life - and why he is a special influence.
