It's been two weeks since US-backed forces took full control of the Syrian city of Raqqa. It ended three years of rule by the so-called Islamic State. Raqqa now lies in ruins, but residents like Mohammad Hassan have joined together to start the restoration effort. Lori Gertz is an author who lives in California and George Ghossn is an actor living on Long Island, New York City. For 42 years they wrote to each other without ever having met in real life. That was, until this year. Stan Hays of Kansas City, US is a barbecue enthusiast. He takes part in competitions to see who can produce the tastiest barbecue food. This obsession has also led Stan to Operation Barbeque Relief. It's an organisation where people travel to natural disaster zones to cook food for the people affected. Tsuneko Sasamoto is known as Japan's first female photo journalist. She began in 1940 and documented the huge changes that happened in Japan before, during and following WWII. But she is best known for photographing pioneering women. Image: Mohammad Hassan in Raqqa Credit: Mohammad Hassan Show less
