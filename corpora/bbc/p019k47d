How is globalisation changing the way we think about ourselves and others? What impact is it having on personal and national identity? Are we all more connected as global citizens now, or is globalisation actually driving us further apart? Joining Bridget Kendall and a lively audience at the Zamyn Cultural Forum 2013, at the Tate Modern Art Gallery, London are: Zimbabwean author NoViolet Bulawayo, Indian political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Nigerian poet and novelist Ben Okri.
