As a teenager Zach Skiles joined the US military, hoping to save money for college. But then 9/11 happened and America invaded Iraq. Zach tried to avoid it, but as a marine he ended up in the invading force. His deployment was bloody and shocking, and he had panic attacks and nightmares. When Zach returned to the US, he struggled to cope with life after war. He started getting treatment, but then a horrifying shooting at his recovery centre proved another devastating event that Zach had to overcome. Jorge Grimaz runs a 'hospital for statues' in Buenos Aires, Argentina. His team repairs broken sculptures as a way to preserve the city's history. In the 1950s, Natalia Bolivar was a rich Cuban socialite with a secret. She was an undercover urban guerrilla in Havana, using her privileged status to try to bring down the government.
