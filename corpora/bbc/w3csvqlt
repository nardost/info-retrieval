Isaiah Acosta was born with situs inversus, which meant all his major organs were in the wrong place, and he hadn't developed a jaw bone. His mother Tarah Acosta was told his life expectancy would be limited and he'd be bedbound. Despite doctors' predictions, Isaiah survived and is able to walk. He does use medical machinery to get food and oxygen, but is unable to speak. Regardless, he's gone on to fulfil his dream of becoming a rapper, with the help of the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and musician Trap House. Peter Holden was a regular on popular children's television programmes in Britain where he would come on and talk about birds to get kids interested in them. But there was one child he couldn't get interested: his own son. Eventually, however, the two bonded over the art of birds' nests. In 1959 jazz radio host Jacques Muyal bumped into trumpeteer Idrees Sulieman in the streets of Tangier. He and persuaded him to record a session in his radio studio with an out-of-tune piano. Jacques went on to become a respected music producer. Some of his rare recordings have recently been released.
