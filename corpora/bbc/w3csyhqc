British diver Chris Lemons was working on an oil well underwater in the North Sea in Scotland. He was connected to a boat with something called an 'umbilical cord', which also provided him with air and heat. But he ended up getting tangled in the line and was stuck on the sea bed with only five minutes of air left in his tank. A rescue team was over 35 minutes away. How he was able to survive has left medical experts baffled. (Image: Chris Lemons when he was rescued from the North Sea bed. Photo courtesy of Dogwoof.) Show less
