In 2003 a Chilean woman called Bernarda Gallardo saw a story in her local paper which changed her life. A dead baby girl had been found on the local rubbish dump, literally thrown out with the household waste. The article had such an impact on her that she made it her mission to give the baby a proper burial. American political activist Mike Bonanno has come up with a highly unusual way of getting his message across. As part of a performance duo called The Yes Men he poses as a top executive from big corporations, surprising unsuspecting audiences with outrageous stunts that comment on social and environmental issues. Imagine having to spend 24 hours a day, every day, in a totally blacked out room. That is what one British woman had to resort to after developing an extreme reaction to all forms of light. She has written a book about her experience under the pen name Anna Lyndsey. When Yemeni film-maker Khadija al-Salami heard about a 10-year-old girl going to court to file for divorce, she recognised her own experience. Reporter Diana Steenbergen found out how Khadija bought the movie rights to the girl's autobiography and four years later began filming her feature - I Am Nojood, Age 10 and Divorced.
