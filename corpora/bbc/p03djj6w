Dr Patrick Njoroge is the recently appointed Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya. He has power over the economic fortunes of millions of people and has vowed to tackle the corruption which has bedevilled the country. But he's also a member of the Catholic organisation Opus Dei, whose most devoted members decide not to marry, live together in communities and turn their backs on material possessions. Adam Walker was working as a salesman for electrical appliances when he decided he wanted a more adventurous life. He became the first and only British swimmer to complete the Oceans 7 Challenge - the seven most challenging open water swims including the English Channel, the Straits of Gibraltar and the Molokai Channel in Hawaii - where he faced sharks, poisonous jellyfish and treacherous seas. Tributes have come from all over the world to David Bowie who has died aged 69. The British singer was a great innovator and style icon whose career spanned five decades. In a rare interview in 2002, he spoke to the BBC's John Wilson about the art of songwriting. When a Brazilian man called Garrafinha came across a circle of huge stone blocks deep in the Amazonian rainforest, he didn't think it was of much importance. But in 2006, archaeologists revealed that the circle of 127 stone blocks was built over a thousand years ago and is believed to be an ancient observatory. Reporter Gibby Zobel went to meet Garrafinha who has now become the caretaker of the ancient monument. (Picture: Dr Patrick Njoroge, the Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya.
