South African runner Caster Semenya shot to fame in 2009 when she won the 800 metres at the World Championships in Berlin. Her performance was so astonishing that some people wondered if she really was a woman. That controversy has dogged Caster throughout her career and she was stopped from competing for a while as the authorities decided what to do. But she's now back competing, and winning. In the Philippines there's a man who raises eyebrows. Tiyo Lopez cycles around his small rural town grooming women's eyebrows. Canadian teacher Spencer Sekyer has a passion for animals, and often spends his vacations volunteering in other parts of the world. So in the Christmas break of 2013, he went to help a vet in a town called Dohuk in Iraq, not that far from Erbil. He became determined to rehome a baby chimpanzee he met there called Manno.
