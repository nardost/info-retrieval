Have you ever felt homesick? What would you have done to get home? Hear about how one family went to reach the UK - all the way from Australia. Glenn MacFadyen grew up in Australia - but his parents were British expats. When his mother started to pine for life in the UK, the couple decided to do something pretty drastic.... Suffice to say, it wasn't plain sailing. The brutal civil war in Sierra Leone lasted for over a decade. As a result of the conflict, the country is home to a high number of amputees. One of these, Bornor Kargbo, has turned to the beautiful game for solace and is now captain of 'The Flying Stars', Freetown's amputee football team. Although she's now an internationally acclaimed photographer, Evgenia Arbugaeva comes from a place few have heard of - the town of Tiksi, a tiny port in Artic Russia. Years later, she decided to return to her childhood home and was inspired to use photography to capture this icy outpost and the people who inhabit it. Frank Randle is a farmer in the American state of Alabama, who began a somewhat surprising business venture. Alabama has a reputation for being a conservative place. But for the past 30 years, Frank has been supplying the local Muslim population with live lambs, and a place to slaughter them in the traditional halal way.
