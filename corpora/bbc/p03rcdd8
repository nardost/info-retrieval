Australian zoo keeper Kylie Bullo released the first zoo-born orangutan into the wild. She tells Jo Fidgen about a few mishaps along the way - including being chased by a swarm of bees and rolling down cliffs. We head to the Mulberry School for Girls in London who were visited by US First Lady Michelle Obama last year. They tell us, as part of Outlook Inspirations - our hunt for the world's most inspirational - who they look up to. We also revisit Didar Hossain, a factory worker from Dhaka in Bangladesh. Three years ago he was at work when he saw the collapse of a garment factory across the street. He saved many lives and faced a challenging decision when faced with a girl trapped in the rubble. We also head to Trinidad and Tobago and Leroy Clarke - the country's 'Master Painter' who's inspired by African spiritual beliefs in his work. (Picture: Kylie Bullo. Credit: Kylie Bullo) Show less
