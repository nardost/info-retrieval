This week's Forum comes from Edinburgh in Scotland where we are part of the TED Global ideas conference. Four distinguished guests and an audience of risk takers and decision makers from around the word probe fresh ideas for business both in the West and in Asia. Pakistani film maker Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy wants to transform business culture in her native country; British American physicist Geoffrey West applies his radical ideas about scaling to company growth; Canadian green technology designer Ron Dembo has counter-intuitive suggestions for reducing energy consumption and Indian sugar producer Rajshree Pathy wants to transform agriculture. Plus insights from a wide range business innovators in the audience.
