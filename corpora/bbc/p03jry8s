The rise of the mobile phone and its role in the revolution of personal communication. In 1945, researchers in the US came up with a way of allowing a weaker telephony signal which could be re-used without interference. This enabled a smaller battery to be held in a hand-held or cellular phone. However it needed the invention of a new technology - microprocessors - before the first cellphone was built.
