Moses Akatugba used to coach a football team made up of prisoners on death row in Delta State, Nigeria. Moses was a death row prisoner himself. He had been arrested when he was 16 and accused of stealing mobile phones in an armed robbery. He says he didn’t do it, and claims that he was tortured into confessing. His case was taken up by human rights campaigners and he was eventually pardoned. But not before he had spent ten years behind bars – the last two of them on death row. At 102-years-old, Man Kaur is India’s oldest competitive runner. In fact, she’s a world record holder. But for the first ninety years of her life, Man didn’t run at all. Outlook’s Chhavi Sachdev has been to meet her and to talk about her late-flowering passion. It’s very difficult to get accurate information about the weather. You can measure what’s going on on the ground – but what about up high up in the sky? In 2015 researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany decided to do an experiment with geese. They wanted to fit little match-box-sized data collectors onto their backs, and see how much information they could get. But to do it they had to find a volunteer who could fly a microlight to go up with the geese and was prepared to raise those geese from chicks. Michael Quetting agreed, not knowing how much the experience would change him. (Picture: Moses Akatugba. Courtesy of Moses Akatugba.) Show less
