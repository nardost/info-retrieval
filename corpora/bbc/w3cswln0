Susan Berg was on a family fishing trip in Australia when their boat sank and they started to swim to land. As the sun went down, Susan realised that her family had disappeared. Since then, she has fought to come to terms with that day and has even overcome her fear of water by taking on daring swimming challenges. She's written a book about her experience called The Girl Who Lived. Wei-shun Yen was a rebellious youngster. While his parents were busy selling noodles in the family restaurant, he was running wild on the streets and was even sent to a Taiwanese prison for manslaughter. It seemed like he was destined for a life of crime, until he had a very influential dream. It inspired him to leave his old ways behind and take up charity work. He is now known around Taiwan for giving noodles to the poor and needy because he donates hundreds of servings each month, with the help of other donors. The BBC’s Taipei correspondent Cindy Sui went to meet the noodle hero, at his family’s restaurant. A Hollywood film called 'King Richard' is going to be made about a very determined father who, with no prior knowledge of the game, managed to train up two of the world's greatest tennis players. We look back to 2014 when we spoke to Richard Williams, the father of American tennis titans Venus and Serena Williams about deciding his daughters would be sporting superstars.
