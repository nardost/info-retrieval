Boko Haram attacked the town of Baga in Borno state in Northern Nigeria in early January. The attack left hundreds, possibly thousands dead. The isolated location and the lack of security have made it very difficult to verify the death toll. Bike is a sixty year old man who survived the attack and managed to run away, but couldn't find his wife and two year old son. He hasn't heard from them since. Comedian Trevor Noah is a huge star in his home country of South Africa. He is now finding fame on a global scale, performing around the world. Trevor grew up in Soweto, the son of a black South African woman and a white father from Switzerland and observations on race and his mixed ethnicity are a big theme in his comedy. Four years after the Tahrir Square protests began in Cairo, Egypt, many of those who took part are disillusioned. They feel they got nothing from the revolution, so if change hasn't arrived on the political stage, some young Egyptians have looked to themselves to make change and started their own personal revolutions. Writer Max Brooks has had a cult following in his native United States due to his popular Zombie Survival books. For many years he has been fascinated by a little known true story of American history - that of the Harlem Hellfighers. He has now turned the lives of the regiment of African American soldiers who fought in World War One into a graphic novel. (Photo: Burnt houses in Baga after the Boko Haram attack.
