The Children's Choir of the USSR sang to their leaders, they sang to their people, and through their songs projected a bright, happy dream of the Soviet Union to the furthest reaches of the Red Empire. Beautiful children and beautiful voices singing sad Russian songs, Soviet fairy tales of progress and hope, and ballads of loss and love from the Great Patriotic War. They could be heard and seen at great state occasions or providing the soundtrack for numerous Soviet cartoons. In doing so, their music shaped an entire generation's childhood - all under the direction of the forceful Victor Popov. Then, in 1991, the world they had sung about ceased to exist and the Soviet Union passed into memory. Show less
