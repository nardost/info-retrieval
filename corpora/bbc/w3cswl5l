Mike Konesky and Bill Akers from Spokane in the United States are part of a group of friends who have been playing the same game of Tag for a staggering 35 years and they're still doing it. One of the Tag brothers even drew up a nine page contract of rules for them all to sign, and another - who's a priest - isn't even safe during his sermons! This is a tale of friendship and fun that has taken Hollywood by storm. Bioni Samp is a DJ with a difference. He's an avid beekeeper who is so passionate about the sounds they make that he’s found a way to transform their buzzing into music that he plays all over Europe. Outlook’s Mariana Des Forges went to his home in North London to meet him and his bees. Ji Seong-ho lost his leg and hand when he was just a boy but it didn't stop him from making an epic journey to escape from North Korea. He made the journey on battered wooden crutches which he still keeps to this day. Image: The Tag Brothers Credit: Mike Konesky Show less
