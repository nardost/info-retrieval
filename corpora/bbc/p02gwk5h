People in north-east Nigeria continue to live in fear after being targeted by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram. Pastor Daniel Awayi leads a church in the town of Potiskum in Yobe state. He says Christians are particularly fearful. His church has come under attack from Boko Haram several times over the past few years, most recently earlier this month. Scott Engstrom is a horse breeder in New Zealand. Her most-prized animals are nine pure-bred Appaloosa stallions, which are incredibly rare. Scott - who was born in the United States - has a theory about the historic roots of the breed which flies in the face of received wisdom. Most experts believe that Appaloosas were brought from Spain to Mexico by the Conquistadors, but she believes they came from Asia. In 2012, Scott set off on an epic journey to remote parts of Kyrgyzstan to try to prove her theory. Nev Broadis has spent most of the last 10 years rescuing bears, many of them cubs, in Cambodia and neighbouring countries. The two species of bear which are native to Cambodia - the sun bear and the moon bear - are facing extinction. But Nev and his team from the Australian charity Free the Bears are determined to save them. The traditional Vietnamese music known as Ca Tru has had a chequered history. It began in royal courts but later became associated with vice and depravity and was rarely performed. Our reporter Marianne Brown has been to Hanoi to meet a woman who has made some difficult sacrifices over the last 30 years to revive the art form. (Photo: Pastor Daniel Awayi) Show less
