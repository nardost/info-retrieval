Foster carers Ron and Penny Jones gave Ahmed Hassan a home. He went on to plant a bomb on the London Underground. Hassan had arrived in the UK in October 2015 as an unaccompanied child refugee. And the story of Rikke Schmidt the Danish woman who was trapped in her body and could only communicate by blinking. She was aware of everything happening around her, but couldn't move or talk - she was completely paralysed except for being able to moving her eyes. Image: Penny and Ron Jones Credit: BBC Show less
