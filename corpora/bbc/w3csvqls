American Kevin Simmers has devoted his life to the war on drugs as a narcotics officer, but he saw addiction in a whole new light after a shock revelation from his daughter, Brooke. In a small city in northern Germany called Greifswald you can find 'The World of Poisons' - half museum, half sanctuary for poisonous animals where Nils Kley encourages the curious to come and meet his venomous snakes, spiders and frogs and see their nicer side. The man known as the 'ICU Grandpa'. David Deutchman volunteers to cradle premature babies in intensive care when their parents aren't able to in the US. Outlook's Stephannie Stokes has been to meet him. (Photo: Kevin Simmers with his daughter, Brooke. Credit: Kevin Simmers.) Show less
