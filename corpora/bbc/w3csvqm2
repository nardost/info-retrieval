British mum Sally Evans had been worried about her teenage son, Thomas, as he was getting involved in petty crime. So when he converted to Islam and cleaned up his act she was relieved. However as she and her other son Micheal recount, they didn't realise he was getting radicalised until it was way too late. We hear how Sally and Micheal coped when they found out Thomas had joined Islamist militant group al-Shabab. Asha De Vos is a marine biologist who runs Sri Lanka's first marine conservation centre, Oceanswell. For the last 10 years, Asha's been working on a project to study and help save endangered pygmy blue whales native to Sri Lanka. She also goes by 'whale poop girl' because of what she's discovered from the animal's excrement. Deep underwater in a grotto off the coast of the Philippine's Bohol province, you can find a 14ft statue of the Virgin Mary. The figure was placed there by a group of deeply religious people, some of whom are priests, to deter illegal dynamite fishing.
