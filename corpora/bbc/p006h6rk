Haiti's psychological scars In the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti, the priorities were to get food, shelter and medical supplies to the hundreds of thousands of people affected. But as well as the scars on their bodies, many survivors are feeling the psychological aftereffects of the earthquake. Dr Lynne Jones is a psychiatrist who works for the US-based International Medical Corps and has been working in Haiti. She has been keeping an audio diary for Outlook. One man and his windmill in Malawi William Kamkwamba was born and brought up in a small village in Malawi. When he was 14, a drought led to a terrible famine and he was forced to leave school because his parents could no longer afford the fees. But William was determined to get an education. By reading books at a local library, he taught himself how to build a windmill to generate electricity for his home community. Now he has written a book about his journey which will soon take him to the prestigious Dartmouth College in the United States. Show less
