Gary Kemp, songwriter and guitarist with hit 80s band Spandau Ballet, chooses the architect and designer Edward William Godwin as his great life. Gary began collecting pieces of Godwin's work as soon as he started making money from hit singles in the 1980s. He's remained fascinated by the life and work of the man who formed part of the Aesthetic Movement in the 19th century, designed houses for Oscar Wilde and James Whistler, and influenced Charles Rennie Mackintosh. The guest expert is Dr Aileen Reid. Producer: Maggie Ayre. Show less
