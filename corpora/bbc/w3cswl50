Title: Dancing Blind With My Horse

Last Broadcast Date: Fri 1 Jun 2018
Verity Smith is originally from the UK but now lives in France and is a top level competitor in dressage, a sport which she describes as 'equestrian ballet'. It's an incredibly challenging and precise sport and for Verity, who is legally blind, it's even more challenging. Outlook Inspirations nominee Fatuma Abdulkadir Adan grew up in the Marsabit area of Northern Kenya. Most of the families there are nomadic farmers who raise cattle, and there has been a history of violent conflict between different tribes competing for the best pasture for their animals. Fatuma wanted to bring peace to her community, and one day she came up with an idea - get people to play football together.

He now runs a website called Xeno-Canto, a growing collection of bird sounds where people from all over the world have posted recordings of cheeps, tweets, songs and warbles. Last month it reached 400,000 recordings. Outlook's Gibby Zobel went to meet him.
