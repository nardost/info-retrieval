Amin Sheikh grew up in a poor Mumbai household and from the age of 5 delivered tea to help feed his family. But after an accident at work he ran away and began begging at the local railway station. Several years later he was offered work with a famous artist who took Amin to Barcelona. The trip inspired him to open his own cafe offering sanctuary to street children. Kurt Flemming is the man behind the make-up of one of Denmark's best known personalities. He plays the iconic pantomime clown Pierrot at one of the world's oldest amusement parks. Dr Jane Goodall, now aged 83, has just received the DVF Lifetime Leadership award for her work with chimpanzees. When she was in her twenties, Jane first set foot on the beach of Gombe, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania to begin her new job observing the chimps at the nature reserve. What she discovered revolutionised our perceptions of primates changing our understanding into the deep connections that we share with them.
