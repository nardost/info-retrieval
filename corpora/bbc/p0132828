A Malian journalist in the strategic town of Gao tells us about the dangers and difficulties of life under rebel control. Djibi Maiga - not his real name - says his radio station has been forced radically to change programme output. Following the announcement from one of Somalia's most notorious pirates that he's giving up crime, we hear again the story of former hostages Paul and Rachel Chandler. They were held in Adado, the town where Mohamed Abdi Hassan made his announcement, which has been a base for many pirates. Also, 23-year-old Soosan Firooz, who's billed as Afghanistan's first female rapper. She has released a song called "Our Neighbours" which tells the story of her childhood as a refugee in Pakistan and Iran and her hopes for the future of Afghanistan. Show less
