In May 2019, British pilot Sam Rutherford took off from an airport in Canada with his co-pilot Alan Simpson. Alan was a pioneering farmer, businessman and grandfather who was also passionate about aviation and had bought a small plane. However, part-way through the flight the plane crashed into the side of a snow-covered mountain. Realising that Alan was badly injured, Sam knew they needed help and fast, so he sent a desperate SMS text message to his wife Beatrice De Smet who was in Europe. What ensued was an extraordinary rescue, involving nine people on snow mobiles. Emily Webb spoke to Sam, Beatrice and Henry Broomfield - the man who led the rescue. As a film-obsessed gay teen, Wes Hurley was thrilled to move to the US from Russia. But his mother’s new husband was moody and homophobic - but after a surprise revelation, they ended up bonding. Wes tells his story to Outlook's Saskia Edwards. He's also made a film about his life, co-directed by Nathan Miller, called Little Potato. Image: Winand Deerenberg/Getty Images Show less
