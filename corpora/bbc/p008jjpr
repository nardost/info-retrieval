Being a surrogate 'mum' to a baby orang-utan From an early age Jeremy Keeling found the company of animals far more rewarding than that of human beings. His family was dysfunctional and his mother cruelly drove him out of the house when he was only twelve years old.

He tells Matthew his remarkable life story which he's also written about in the book 'Jeremy and Amy'. Illustration above: Jeremy Keeling and his orang-utan Amy. Show less
