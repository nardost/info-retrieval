Ugandan celebrity Moses Supercharger was so ill due to HIV, his family was convinced he would die. He was put on a pickup truck that was travelling to his home village for burial. How he survived and continued singing. It's not uncommon in South Korea to see people eating alone. But look more closely at the screens of their computers or phones, and you'll see that in fact some of them do have company of a sort. They are sharing their meal time with so-called Mukbang BJs, who video themselves eating and record the sounds they make, so that diners can watch and listen to them while they eat.
