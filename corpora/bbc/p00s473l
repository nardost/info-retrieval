Is there something morally distorted in a world where you can rent a womb for a woman to carry your baby? Or take a gamble on other people's ill health by dealing in the new market in death bonds?

Testing his ideas are Chinese writer Jianying Zha and Indian social entrepreneur Harish Hande. Illustration by Emily Kasriel: the market driving out civic values. Show less
