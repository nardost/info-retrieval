Joel de Carteret was born in Manila in the Philippines and lived there with his family. But one day, when he was just four, he wandered away from home and got lost. This is the story of Joel, his adoptive mum, Julie, and the birth mother that he never forgot, all in conversation with Outlook's Emily Webb. Jeremie Saunders is an actor from Canada. He has cystic fibrosis, a terminal condition which severely damages the organs. The life expectancy of people with CF is low - when Jeremie was 10 years old, he read in a pamphlet that he would die at 30. He's 29 years old now and has launched the podcast Sickboy, where he, his friends and family talk openly of how to deal with terminal illness and death.
