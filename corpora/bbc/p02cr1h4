Linda Pressly explores the impact of Colombia's most notorious drug baron, Pablo Escobar, who was killed in a hail of bullets in 1993. Two decades after his death, he still looms large in the Colombian psyche. In some quarters, there is an ambivalence towards this ruthless killer, an admiration for the man who made an estimated US $20 billion and built homes for the poor. But many reject the Robin Hood image, and see his legacy as deeply corrosive. Linda Pressly meets victims, a cartel-insider, and Pablo Escobarâ€™s sister as she finds out how the story of this most notorious drug-runner, torturer and murderer still resonates in his home city of Medellin.
