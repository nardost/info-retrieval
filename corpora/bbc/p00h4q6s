Reverend Dr Edward Norman, Dean of Peterhouse, Cambridge, explores who the 'Ministers of Change' are in society in his second Reith lecture. Speaking from the series entitled 'Christianity and the World Order' Norman investigates the effect of the secular states' political values on Christianity.

Reverend Norman considers the link between religion and politics by investigating the increased influence of The World Council of Churches in developing countries. Show less
