Sixteen million American children live in families struggling to get by as child poverty reaches record levels in the USA. British writer and film-maker Jezza Neuman shows the reality of life for some of these children, including 10-year-old Kaylie Haywood. Zoltan Takacs is the Hungarian man who travels the world hunting poisonous snakes to extract their venom to develop new medicines. But he's not the ideal man for the job - he's allergic to snake venon, and the antidote. Nagieb Khaja made a film about Helmand province by giving local people cameras to capture the reality of life in rural villages. The resulting documentary is called My Afghanistan: Life in the Forbidden Zone. Dr Gamal Albinsaid is the young Indonesian doctor who came up with the innovative idea of letting the poorest people in his area have access health-care by allowing them to pay for a doctor with garbage. Asra Nomani was a friend and colleague of Daniel Pearl. After he was beheaded by militants she was determined to use her skills as a reporter to track down all those involved - she tells Matthew how she came face to face with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed who claimed responsibility for the killing. And Tracey Curtis-Taylor is the British woman who flew from Cape Town to Cairo in a 1930s bi-plane - with an open cockpit!
