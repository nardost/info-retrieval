Personal stories behind the news from all over the world. WIth Matthew Bannister. On today's programme: Crime of the Century; Sexist baboons in Kenya; Living off rubbish. Crime of the Century Shaquille Smith was just 14 years old when he was stabbed to death in London last year. Now his death has been turned into a new play, 'Crime of the Century', by the Chickenshed theatre group. Matthew spoke to Daniel Banton, Shaquille's cousin, who plays the killer in the production, and to Paul Morrall - Shaquille's uncle, who is the director of education and outreach at the theatre company. Sexist Baboons in Kenya Farms in the Kimuchu area of Kenya are been targeted by baboons who are destroying crops. But the problem is far worse for the women farmers, because the baboons run away when chased by men, but aren't frightened of the women. Our reporter Michael Kaloki reports.

Phnom Penh's main rubbish dump is about to close - leaving the freelance scavengers and their families without an income, support network, or hope. Our correspondent in Cambodia, Guy De Launey, went to meet them. Show less
