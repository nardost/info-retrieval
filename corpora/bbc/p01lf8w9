Aloisio da Silva and Argemiro dos Santos tell the extraordinary story of how they were taken from their orphanage and forced to work for Nazi sympathisers in 1930s Brazil. A chance discovery of swastika-embossed bricks uncovered their story. Manal al-Sharif tells us about her struggle to drive in Saudi Arabia, and how she's still campaigning for greater equality for women. Sikh writer Jaspreet Singh remembers the event which haunts his latest book, "Helium": the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Ghandi by her Sikh bodyguards. And former car mechanic Jorge Odon from Argentina explains how a party trick inspired him to invent the Odon Device to make childbirth safer.
