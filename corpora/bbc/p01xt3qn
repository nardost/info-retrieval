Ziggy Marley is the eldest son of the legendary reggae artist, Bob Marley - and a singer-songwriter in his own right. When Bob Marley died in 1981, Ziggy was just 13. He and his sisters performed at his state funeral. Family and music remain important to Ziggy today. Elena Rocco's son, Enrico, was born with a rare genetic disorder. She has founded a radio station called Radio Magica, aimed at all children, including those with special needs. Michel Moufarrege has been described as the godfather of hiking in Lebanon.
