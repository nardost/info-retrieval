Indian inventor Arunachalam Muruganantham devised a low cost sanitary pad that has transformed the lives of millions of women. It took him years of experiments, and much personal sacrifice, to come up with the simple machine. Now scriptwriter Jon Sen has turned Arunachalam's story into a romantic radio comedy called The Man Who Wore Sanitary Pads - starring Navin Chowdhry. (Photo: Human Rights Lawyer Hina Jilani.
