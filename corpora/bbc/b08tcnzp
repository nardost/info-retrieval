Last Broadcast Date: Mon 19 Jun 2017
Laurie Taylor talks to David Papineau - Professor of Philosophy at Kings College London - whose latest book addresses the philosophical questions that sport raises, from highlighting the difference between rules and conventions to challenging the orthodox economic view of altruism and group decision making. Dr Paul Ian Campbell is Course Director for Sociology and Senior Lecturer at Coventry University. He talks to Laurie about the ethnographic study he has carried out of an African-Caribbean-founded football club in the East Midlands. The development of the club during the period that he covers - 1970 to 2010 - was intimately connected to wider changes in the social and sporting landscape. Producer: Torquil MacLeod. Show less
