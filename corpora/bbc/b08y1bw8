International Express - the New York City Transit Authority 7 subway line runs through a highly diverse series of ethnic and immigrant neighborhoods in Queens. It's a microcosm of the urban, New York experience, in which individuals from a variety of cultures and classes are forced to interact and get along. William Kornblum, professor of sociology emeritus at the Graduate Center, City University of New York, talks to Laurie Taylor about the everyday reality of integrated mass transit. They're joined by the British writer, Iain Sinclair and the geographer, Melissa Butcher. Show less
