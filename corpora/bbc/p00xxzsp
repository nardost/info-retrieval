Extraordinary stories from around the world. Today, the Dutch woman who was conned into taking a bomb on board a plane to Bethlehem. Also, the Somali artist who was commissioned to paint the official portraits of his country's former dictator Siad Barre, and is now painting for peace on the walls of Mogadishu. And the Latino man from New York who makes his living by impersonating President Barack Obama. (Image: Catharina Windemeijer) Show less
