The Deputy Mayor of the Italian island of Giglio, Mario Pellegrini, tells Matthew Bannister how he rescued passengers from the Costa Concordia. The cruise ship sank on 13 January, after hitting a rock on the Italian coast. We also bring together Ko Mya Aye, a newly-released Burmese pro-democracy leader in Rangoon with his daughter in London. And some lessons in acting tough from Alison de Burgh, the first woman in Britain to be accredited as a stage fight director. (Picture: The cruise liner Costa Concordia. Credit: AFP) Show less
