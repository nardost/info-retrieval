"Sometimes I don't know the difference between talking to the living and talking to the dead." Anne is a 37-year-old mother of two. She lives on a perfectly normal housing estate in a medium-sized Irish town, about a half-hour’s drive from Dublin. Her husband, Paul, is a carpenter. From the outside, her life looks as normal as any other. But after her sons have left for school and Paul has gone to work, Anne sits down at her kitchen table to talk to spirits. Anne is a medium and communing with the dead is part of her daily life. Anne tells Colette Kinsella what it’s like to have a life like the film, The Sixth Sense, how bored spirits play havoc with her love life, and why grocery shopping is a challenge. Show less
