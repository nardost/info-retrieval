Ignacio Hurban was 36 years old when he made the shocking discovery that he had been at the centre of a national scandal in Argentina without knowing it. During the military dictatorship, hundreds of babies were snatched from their imprisoned mothers and given away to people who were considered more sympathetic to the regime. Ignacio found out he was one of those stolen children and that his real surname was Montoya Carlotto. He was now faced with a new family and the kind of fame that he never asked for. Shaun Sears and Tom Otto are professional tree climbers from the United States.

When the brothers-in-laws discovered that cats love to climb these giant trees and often find they can't get down again, the self-confessed cat lovers decided to do something about it.
