John Wilson presents Radio 4's obituary programme, analysing and reflecting on the lives of people who have recently died. On this week's programme the solitary Hope Bourne, who lived in a caravan, shot animals for supper, and was known as the Lady of Exmoor. We hear how Corinne Day's portraits of Kate Moss changed the face of fashion. Former ELO drummer Bev Bevan remembers his bandmate Mike Edwards. And the wildly varied life of Micky Burn. He saluted Hitler as a youth, but later embraced Marxism. He led a daring commando raid in the war and ended up in Colditz. He was a gay man who was married to a woman for 27 years. Show less
