Winston Trew came to England from Jamaica in the 1950s and joined a group that aimed to educate children from the Caribbean about their history and teach them pride. After one of their meetings, he was arrested and falsely accused of stealing handbags. He then spent nearly 50 years trying to clear his name. There aren't lots of opportunities for young people in Villa 31, one of the most crowded and violent slums in Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires. But one of the young residents has made quite a future for himself as an extremely talented golfer. His name is Dylan Reales and our reporter Colm Flynn went to meet him. Ikebana is the ancient Japanese art of making very complicated sculptures out of flowers. Artist Raku Inoue is originally from Japan but now lives in Canada and he uses the technique to make works of art that look like creatures. Raku constructs these beautiful pieces to honour the memory of his grandfather. Picture: Winston Trew Credit: Alice Gioia, BBC Show less
