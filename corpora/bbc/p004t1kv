The United Nations children's fund - UNICEF -is appealing for urgent aid for displaced children in northern Yemen. The award winning Egyptian actor Mahmoud Kabil is a UNICEF goodwill ambassador. He's just returned from visiting a camp for displaced people in Hajjah province. The camp was originally designed to house seven thousand people - but now has more than nine thousand - with a further four thousand living around it. Mahmoud tells Matthew Bannister about the desperate situation the children are in. Australia's blind dance star. Taking part in one of those dance competitions on TV must be challenging for all the contestants - but for Australian Gerrard Gosens it was even tougher than usual. Because Gerrard - who loves adventure and is a paralympian - has been blind from birth.
