American lawyer, Daniel Belardinelli, was visiting a court in New Jersey when some sketches hanging on the wall caught his eye. He discovered that they were made by a man called Robert Sundholm. He was working as the building's janitor, but Daniel thought he had found a future star of the art world. Former British Army soldier, Leslie Binns was within days of achieving his lifelong ambition to climb to the summit of Mount Everest, when he came across Sunita Hazra on the trail. She had run out of oxygen and was close to death. To save her life, he would have to abandon his dream.
