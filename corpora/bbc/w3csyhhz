The Knight family are from Norwich in the UK and they are wrestlers. They spent years striving for stardom. The parents, Ricky and Saraya Knight, met through the sport and when they started their own wrestling business, their children also caught the entertainment bug. But when one of their daughters, Paige, became a WWE superstar in America, her success threatened to tear the family apart. This is a sporting story that spans generations and continents. The Knight wrestling dynasty not only survived chokeslams and anaconda squeezes in the ring - but high dives and bitter lows in real life. Image: (L) L-R: Ricky, Saraya, Zak and Paige Knight.
