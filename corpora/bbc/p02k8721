A year on from Kiev's Maidan massacre, Volodomir Golodniuk talks about his pride in his teenage son, Ustym, shot dead by an unidentified sniper. Dai Donovan and Jonathan Blake - a Welsh miner and English gay activist - recall the surprising alliance Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners or LGSM - that raised money to help support the families of Welsh miners in 1980s conservative Britain. Janet and Graham Walton - the British couple who had six baby girls in four minutes. It was a world first, and the Waltons have lived in the media spotlight ever since. Ray Chen - Taiwanese-Australian virtuoso violinist on how chopsticks and a guitar inspired him to pick up his instrument. Picture: Photos of Ustym Golodniuk displayed as a memorial to him Show less
