Joe Borelli is a New York City councilman who spoke on behalf of Donald Trump during the presidential campaign - he was thrilled when Trump won the election last November, and approached the Trump presidency with high expectations. Over the first 100 days of the Trump Administration Joe recorded his impressions of the new President, starting with a visit to the Inauguration in Washington on 20th January. As the weeks went by with controversy about the executive order travel ban and the battle in the courts, the Presidential well received address to Congress, and through the twitter storms prompted by Donald Trump’s tweets about the intelligence agencies and President Obama, Joe recorded his observations. In ‘Me and the President” we find out if Joe’s expectations are met by the first 100 days of President Trump. Polling indicates Joe’s enthusiasm is shared by Donald Trump’s supporters, despite the new President starting his term of office with record low levels of approval from American voters generally. At the end of 100 days does Joe believe those people who were unconvinced by President Trump at the outset will come round to him as he pushes aheads with his policies of bringing back jobs, building a wall, and taking on the Washington establishment - or whether what the President has done since January has hardened attitudes, on both sides?
