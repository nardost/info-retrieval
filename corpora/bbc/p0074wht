Personal stories behind the news from all over the world. With Matthew Bannister. Fred Ouko; The Charlie Circle; UK election photographer Fred Ouko It's estimated that over sixty per cent of the unemployed in Kenya are young people, but Fred Ouko is hoping to bring them some much needed help. Fred contracted polio when he was only two. The disease left him severely disabled, but he became an academic success at school and went on to set up the Kibera Community Youth Programme, which aims to help young people learn the skills they need to find work. He tells Matthew about the Programme. The Charlie Circle Nivedita Pathak meets some of the members of "The Charlie circle". Based in Adipur, in the Indian state of Gujarat, the group is made up of fans of the silent movie star Charlie Chaplin. It now has two hundred and fifty members, whose ages range from seventy-two right down to two year old toddlers. UK Election photographer Simon Roberts is the first photographer to be appointed as the official "general election artist" by Britain's House of Commons. He's currently travelling the length and breadth of Britain aiming to capture images of the election that have been ignored by the day to day media coverage. He tells Matthew Bannister about his trip and why he's also inviting members of the public to send in their own photos which he's putting on his website. Show less
