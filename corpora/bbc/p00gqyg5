Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, a remarkable interview with Ameneh Bahrami. In 2004, she was an independent young woman living in the Iranian capital Tehran. But her life changed forever when a rejected suitor called Majid Movahedi threw acid into her face, leaving terrible scars and blinding her in both eyes. Ameneh started a campaign for him to be tried under an Islamic law which allows victims to have a say in the punishment of criminals. She wanted Movahedi to be sentenced to have acid poured into his eyes - and what's more, she wanted to administer the punishment herself. She won her case, although after an international outcry, the sentence is yet to be carried out. Show less
