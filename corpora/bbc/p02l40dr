Nearly 20 years after the war in the Balkans, many survivors are still traumatised. Sabiha Husic now devotes her life to helping them. She was in her early 20s when the war broke out. Her family are Muslim, but lived in a predominantly Christian area, and were forced to flee. In her new home of Zenica, Sabiha began helping other survivors. She started a charity called Medica Zenica which continues to provide support to people who have experienced the violence of war. The Chinese-American author Tess Gerritsen has sold over 40 million copies of her books worldwide. Drawing on her experiences as a medical doctor, she often gives gory details of the crimes at the heart of her work. Her latest novel Die Again, which is set in the South African bush is no exception. Valentin Gruener is originally from Germany and runs a wildlife park in Botswana. Three years ago he rescued an abandoned lion cub. He called her Sirga, and he raised her by hand. Now she has grown up, Valentin and Sirga have become inseparable. American photographer Richard Misrach and Mexican composer Guillermo Galindo are two artists who have come together to depict the migrant experience on the Mexican/US border. Richard has spent 15 years taking pictures of items left behind by migrants. Then he met Guillermo who was making music about the migrant experience. Richard now collects pieces he finds and sends them to Guillermo who turns them into instruments. Picture credit: Getty Images Show less
