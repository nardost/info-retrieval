LaVonte Stewart grew up in an area of the American city of Chicago where gangs were part of everyday life. He was drawn into that world himself - but after a spell in prison, he changed his path. Now he runs a programme called Lost Boyz Inc. which works to keep young people out of crime. In the icy arctic waters off Greenland lives a mysterious creature called the Greenland Shark. It can be as large as a Great White but very little else is known about it. Danish biologist Julius Nielsen decided to unearth the truth and found that some were over 200 years old. Photos of the sharks can be seen on his Instagram: @juniel85 Emmanuel 'Jagari' Chanda rose to fame in Zambia in the 1970s as the lead singer of the psychedelic rock band Witch. He toured much of Southern Africa, and his onstage antics made him one of the biggest figures of the Zamrock scene. Regional conflict and the AIDs pandemic put an end to the Zamrock scene and Jagari spent many years in the wilderness, but now he's back on stage once again.
