Series of biographical discussions with Matthew Parris. David Attenborough nominates the largely forgotten 17th century-inventor and illustrator. His beautiful drawings of microscopic animals first attracted Attenborough to Hooke, who also helped to design the dome of St Paul's and claimed to have arrived at some of Isaac Newton's groundbreaking laws before Newton himself. Biographer Lisa Jardine joins in the debate. Show less
