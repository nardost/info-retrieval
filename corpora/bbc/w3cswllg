As the Nigerian military continues its efforts to contain the insurgency of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram it has recruited local hunters to help. One of them stands out - because she's a woman. Aisha Bakari Gombi from Gombi town in Adamawa State spent much of her childhood shooting antelopes. Now she's hunting down Boko Haram fighters and has become something of a folk hero in her community. The Skid Row area of Los Angeles is known as a place where thousands of people sleep rough every night - where there are drug problems and a high crime rate. It's not the kind of place where you'd expect to meet a judge - and certainly not one dressed in running kit. But that's exactly what you'll find if you come across Superior Court Judge Craig Mitchell. He's started a running club on Skid Row which takes struggling people and puts them on their feet again, quite literally. Ellen Von Unwerth once got Lady Gaga to sit on a park bench with a skeleton, and persuaded film star Hugh Grant to juggle with lemons. She's a German photographer known for her playful and sometimes provocative pictures of A-list celebrities and supermodels like Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer.
