Inventors: From a homemade airship, to a bionic arm, we meet inventors whose creations have changed their lives. Shi Songbo is from Henan Province in China. He grew up in a rural area and has never stepped foot on a plane, but that hasn't stopped him trying to build his very own airship. Our next inventor is credited with almost finishing off an entire industry. In 1982 Howard Scott Warshaw created the video game to accompany the Hollywood movie ET. The film was a huge hit, but the game became one of the biggest flops of all time and put his employer, Atari, at risk. Six months ago mechanic I Wayan Sumardana from Bali suffered a stroke that paralysed his left arm. It meant he could no longer work. Desperate to provide for his young family, I Wayan decided to build himself a mechanical arm out of scrap mental. Of course it's not just engineers that invent. Writers, artists and songwriters create new stories and techniques on a daily basis. Park Seo-Bo is regarded as the father of Modern Art in his native South Korea and is most famous for his series of plain white paintings, which he started in the 1960's. (L) Photo: Shi Shongbo.
