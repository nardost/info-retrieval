"Temara" is an orangutan who was born and grew up in a zoo in Perth, Australia. She has now been released into the wild thanks to Australian zoo keeper Kylie Bullo. Kylie tells Jo Fidgen about some of the mishaps along the way - including being chased by a swarm of bees. Pedro Martín Núñez was just two-years-old when he ended up in one of Mexico's most notorious prisons with his mother. We hear about his life as a young child growing up in prison and how he managed to escape a life of crime and is now helping others. Novelist Bonnie-Sue Hitchcock tells Jo Fidgen about some of the challenges of bringing up four teenagers on an Alaskan fishing boat. Lemn Sissay was an official poet for the London 2012 Olympics and works to support new writers. Much of his own poetry focuses on his difficult upbringing. Lemn was brought up by a foster family, but when he was 18 he received his birth certificate and discovered his real name and identity. He tells the story of his childhood and finally meeting his Ethiopian mother. Image credit (L) Bonnie-Sue Hitchcock (R) Temara and Kylie Bullo Show less
