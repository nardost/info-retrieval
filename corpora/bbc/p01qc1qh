Edgar Perez was a successful Greco Roman wrestler in his native Guatemala. But the horrors of the long running civil war in the 1980s made him change direction and train as a human rights lawyer. Australian Allan Pease is known as "Mr. Body Language", and has advised many politicians and celebrities on how to present themselves in public, including Russian President Vladmir Putin. In 2000 British film-maker Marc Singer made a documentary called "Dark Days" about a community of homeless people living extraordinary, resourceful lives in the underground railway tunnels beneath the streets of New York. He became so interested in them that he eventually moved in himself. Image: Edgar Perez, Photo credit: Emma Marshall Show less
