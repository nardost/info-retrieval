This week we look at sharing – wealth, power, responsibility and of course, ideas. When it comes to the world’s new economic giants, which country has done better at meeting the needs of those trapped in poverty? Are there universal principles or does each country have to find its own path? And what’s the role of democracy? Joining Bridget Kendall to discuss these huge issues are: Nobel Prize-winning economist and philosopher Amartya Sen, who asks why the elite in his native India are happy to benefit from the country’s economic growth, but ignore the devastating poverty and inequality right under their noses. Professor of Global Economics, Yasheng Huang, who believes his native China is heading for a major financial crisis unless the government begins to share more of its GDP (Gross Domestic Product) with ordinary Chinese households. Middle Eastern politics professor Salwa Ismail, who says that recent protests in Egypt, Turkey and Brazil show that many people around the world now feel electoral democracy is simply not allowing them to share real power.
