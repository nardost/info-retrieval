Artist and film-maker Julian Schnabel talks to Philip Dodd. In 1980 he took part in the Venice Biennale and then became known for creating a series of paintings on broken ceramic plates before turning to directing films including The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on Jean-Dominique Bauby's memoir about living with locked-in syndrome following a stroke, Before Night Falls starring Javier Bardem, and a biopic of the painter Basquiat. The pianist Alice Herz-Sommer, who gave concerts while she was incarcerated in Terez√≠n, was the oldest known holocaust survivor until her death last week at the age of 110. Michael Goldfarb considers her life. Michael Goldfarb's new book is called Emancipation, How Liberating Europe's Jews from the Ghetto Led to Revolution and Renaissance. Producer: Natalie Steed.
