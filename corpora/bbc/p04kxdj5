When Seema Aziz started the fashion house Bareeze, doubters told her she was crazy. Against the odds Seema built one of Pakistan's most famous brands, but when a devastating flood hit her factory outside Lahore she decided to turn her attention to the welfare of her workers. The result is the CARE Foundation and over 700 schools to educate poorer children across Pakistan. As a newly-elected MP in Zambia, Princess Kasune announced her HIV-positive status and challenged her fellow politicians to be tested for the virus. But her quest to prevent the spread of HIV goes back even further. Not long after she got her results, Princess pretended to be a sex worker, so she could educate truck drivers about safe sex.
