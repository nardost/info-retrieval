In 2002, Mauritanian engineer Mohamedou Salahi was detained by American intelligence services. They believed he was a senior figure in al-Qaeda and took him to Guantanamo Bay, the notorious US prison camp. Mohamedou was held there for 14 years without charge and during which time he says he was tortured. A glimmer of light came in the form of an unexpected and life-changing friendship he would make with one of his American guards. This is the first of a two-part story, listen out for the second episode next week or download it in a single podcast which will be available from 24 August, 2019.
