The 23 year old was born with arthrogryposis which has left her unable to use her arms and legs. Despite this, she has gone on to achieve her dream of being a singer and earlier this year a film documentary about her won an Oscar. Steve Vickers catches up with Prudence as she and her group Liyana perform at the Harare International Festival of the Arts.

He was often in trouble with the local authorities as he competed with other kids to paint his signature in more and more high profile locations.

He tells Matthew Bannister about the project. Nigeria's most glamorous farmer Mosunmola Umoru is Nigeria's most glamorous farmer.
