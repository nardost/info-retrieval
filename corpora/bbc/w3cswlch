Lindy Ortega is famous on the country music scene for the exquisite sadness of her music. But until recently she hasn't spoken about the cause of her unhappiness - she has body dysmorphic disorder - which makes her believe that she is repulsively ugly. Venezuela has just lost one of its great musicians - Jose Abreu - and declared three days of national mourning. Jose founded an internationally-acclaimed programme of teaching classical music in the country's poor neighbourhoods, with the aim of combating poverty through music. It was called El Sistema, and started in 1975 and was replicated in countries around the world. Jose spoke to Outlook's Irene Caselli in 2013. The Bhutanese government won't allow churches to be built in the country, so Christians in the capital, Thimpu, have taken to worshipping in secret locations. But the ban on churches means they also have nowhere to bury their dead - which creates some difficulties. Outlook's Candida Beveridge has been to Bhutan to investigate. Nick Padilla is a magician. He'd always wanted to be one and started playing around with magic when he was just six years old. If you've ever watched Amazon's hit show, Sneaky Pete, it's his hands you see doing the card tricks... But magic has always been more than a job for Nick; he reckons it saved his life. Outlook's Colm Flynn went to find out how. (Picture: Lindi Ortega. Credit: Kate Nutt.) Show less
