On Start The Week Andrew Marr talks to John Akomfrah about his latest film installation about memory and movement, focusing on the experiences of migrant workers in the West Midlands. Robert McCrum argues that Globish - Global English - has now conquered the world, while Oscar Guardiola-Rivera counters with the question, 'What if Latin America Ruled the World?', and it's not just in football that South America shows flair and imagination. Emily Doolittle isn't talking to the animals, she's listening to their song, and asking how far animal sounds can be classed as music. Producer: Katy Hickman. Show less
