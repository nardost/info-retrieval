Last Broadcast Date: New Year's Day 2017
This week Last Word departs slightly from its usual format, when Matthew Bannister and the BBC obituary editor Nick Serpell return to the beginning of 2016 and recall a time when obituarists were in huge demand. Together they discuss the challenges and processes involved in commemorating so many big names in so short a time; David Bowie, Alan Rickman, Terry Wogan, Paul Daniels, Ronnie Corbett , Victoria Wood and Prince. Producer: Neil George. Show less
