Matthew Sweet and guests discuss the state of academic philosophy in the UK today. It's often thought of as being difficult, abstract, and far-removed from the concerns of every-day life. It even came up recently in the US Presidential campaign, when Republican hopeful Marco Rubio claimed America needs fewer philosophers and more welders. So what is the place of philosophy in today's universities? And what role can it play in wider culture? Few people in the UK have done more to help philosophers reach a wider audience than Bryan Magee, whose TV interviews with leading philosophers were prime-time viewing in the 1970s and '80s. As Magee publishes a new book, Ultimate Questions, Matthew and his guests discuss his legacy as a broadcaster who interpreted philosophy for a wider audience. With with philosophers MM McCabe, Lucy O'Brien, Nigel Warburton and Constantine Sandis. Ultimate Questions by Bryan Magee is out now from Princeton University Press. Producer: Luke Mulhall. Show less
