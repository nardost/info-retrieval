Douglas Coupland, Shumon Basar and Hans Ulrich Obrist explain the Extreme Present to Matthew Sweet. Their co-authored book The Age of Earthquakes builds on Marshall McLuhan's analysis of how technology influenced culture in the 1960s and is described as "a new history of how we are feeling in the world today when the future seems to be happening much faster than we ever thought. When your life stops feeling like a story, you stop feeling like an individual and technology remembers everything you don't have to". Also, maths and mathematicians in film. Ahead of the release of Morgan Matthews' comedy drama X+Y which focuses on a socially awkward teenage maths prodigy, mathematician Hannah Fry and film critic Kevin Jackson explore the ways in which number-crunching geniuses have been depicted on the big screen.
