Police officer Arun Jadhav and six of his colleagues were on duty during the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks when their van was ambushed by two of the gunmen. The officers were on their way to help at a hospital targeted by the militants. The attackers seized their vehicle, opened fire on the police, and within minutes, Arun’s colleagues were dead. Arun tells Outlook how he survived the attack by hiding under his colleague's bodies and playing dead. Pierre Thiam left Senegal in the late 1980s to study physics and chemistry at a university in the US state of Ohio. But things didn’t go exactly to plan. During a stopover in New York to see some friends, Pierre was robbed of all of his possessions. He took a job in a restaurant to make ends meet, and he’s been a fixture in New York’s restaurant world ever since. He’s an award-winning chef and restauranteur, known for bringing authentic African dishes to New York diners. He spoke to Outlook's Dany Mitzman.
