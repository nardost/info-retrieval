It is now a year since the German Chancellor Angela Merkel threw Germany’s borders open to thousands of stranded Syrian refugees and told the German people: “Wir schaffen das” - we’ll manage this. The last year has been tough for the refugees. We follow five of them and for most it has been a year of uncertainty, a year of unending bureaucratic hurdles, a year of struggle with German grammar. But it has been a good year for Ahmed, because in April his wife and two-year-old son were able to make the journey from Aleppo to be reunited with him in Germany. The family is about to move into a flat in a small village three hours’ drive from Berlin. But as political pressure has increased on the German government, new laws have been passed that make family reunification less likely. Mohamed and his 17-year-old daughter are still waiting to hear if their application to stay in Germany will be approved. Mohamed’s 10-year-old son is in Damascus and he has lost a leg. Mohamed is frightened that even if he is able to stay he won’t be able to bring his son to Germany. Noor, meanwhile, has become engaged to be married. Ebtesam, a woman in her 40s, and Ahmed, a man in his 50s are also waiting for the letter that tells them they can stay in Germany. Ahmed is now talking about leaving anyway. “I don’t care where it is,” he says, “as long as I’m with my family. Nicaragua will do.” (Photo: Ahmed grinning as he cuddles his two-year-old son Omar) Show less
