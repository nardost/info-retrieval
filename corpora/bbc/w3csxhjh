Musician Kojey Radical, travels to Accra in Ghana, a country that he has not been to since he was 12 years old. Born and raised in London, 25-year-old Radical is a spoken word-poet and rapper, a dancer, model, illustrator and video artist. The son of Ghanaian parents, he grew up channelling his energy into writing poetry, and went on to study illustration at London College of Fashion before turning to music. In Accra Kojey collaborates with Kyekyeku, part of a new generation of young lively Ghanaian musicians combining the musical traditions of highlife and afrobeat , who also sees himself as a social chronicler of contemporary Africa. Kojey begins to discover and understand more about his own diaspora, visiting Independence Square and the mausoleum of Kwame Nkrumah, who he first learnt about through conversations with his dad. He also visits YFM the number one Urban Youth radio station in Ghana, before heading to a local rehearsal studio. His challenge is to create a new track with Kyekyeku and a group of local musicians.
