Aisha Omar Ahmed gave up a medical career in Europe to run the San Martino hospital in Mogadishu. Many of her patients have gunshot wounds, whilst the hospital is also a temporary home to hundreds of people seeking sanctuary from the violence that has devastated the city. George DeVincenzi is one of only a handful of surviving guards who worked on Alcatraz, the notorious prison in San Francisco. Despite witnessing extreme violence, he now visits the island regularly and gives talks and tours to visitors fascinated by the prison's past. Kitwana Robinson was a statistician from Kingston, Jamaica before a series of strokes at the age of 25 left him with partial paralysis. He wasn't expected to survive, but he's become keen on art and is now holding an exhibition of his work. (Image: An adult's hand and a child's hand with a cannula, Credit: Getty Images) Show less
