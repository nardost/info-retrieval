Tacita Dean has travelled the world pursuing her interest in landscape phenomena, capturing them on film and then editing that material to produce her art. In a new exhibition at London's Royal Academy she presents works new and old on everything from cloudscapes to the cosmos. Dean who trained as a painter talks to Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough about the importance of courting the unknown and the mercurial qualities of film image, flares, flaws and all. Then focus on mountains and those who climb them. New Generation Thinker Ben Anderson reflects on an interplay between climbing and photography and how posing led to new understandings of what happens to the human body as it switches between stillness and movement plus the role mountains played in the intellectual development of the 19th century physicist and poet, John Tyndall with Tyndall's biographer, Roland Jackson and literary scholar Gregory Tate. Tacita Dean Landscape is at the Royal Academy until August 12th.
