Saul Dreier is a Holocaust survivor and musician. He’s always tried to find the joy in life - even in Nazi concentration camps where he taught himself to play the spoons. After World War Two, he moved to the US and stopped playing music. That is until he was 89 years old, when he felt the urge to buy a drum kit and start a klezmer band. When James Wong first encountered fortune cookies, they were ammunition in food fights with other children. Now an adult, he handles fortune cookies with much more care - he's a fortune writer for his family's fortune cookie company - the biggest in the world. Outlook's Colm Flynn went to meet him in New York City. Farhan Warfaa has never been to school. He used to work as a farmer, and now has a small shop in Somaliland where he sells groceries to support his family. This year he travelled half way around the world to a courtroom in the US, to confront taxi driver Yusuf Abdi Ali, someone he'd last seen 30 years ago. Back then, Ali was a colonel in Somalia’s army, and had ordered Farhan’s torture. Farhan tells his story to Jo Fidgen. Samantha Steinke grew up in Canada in a family passionate about horses. When her own beloved horse Cash died in an accident, she was studying engineering and created a special harness to help horses recover from serious limb injuries.
