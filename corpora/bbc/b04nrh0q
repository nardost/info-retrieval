Last Broadcast Date: Mon 10 Nov 2014
Do we value longevity more than quality of life, towards our final years? That's the discussion Andrew Marr's having with surgeon Atul Gawande, who's giving this year's Reith Lectures. Joining them in the studio are the legendary editor, novelist and memoirist Diana Athill, who has recently written about her attitude to death and the process of dying; Professor Deborah Bowman who advises on the ethics of medical care, including whether to prolong life when death is imminent; and Dr Carl Watkins, who has examined the idea of "a good death" from Medieval times until now. Atul Gawande's Reith lectures start on Radio 4 on Tuesday 25th November at 9am and are also broadcast on BBC World Service. Producer: Simon Tillotson. Show less
