Last Broadcast Date: Thu 15 Nov 2012
Philip Dodd chairs a debate on Immigration and the Challenge to Belonging at the Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival. What does it mean to belong today? Immigration is a highly sensitive and polarising issue that throws up big questions about belonging and identity. Multiculturalism, integration and social division are increasingly part of the political debate. But what impact does immigration have on everyone's sense of national identity? Debaters include the director of the influential Demos think-tank David Goodhart, Alp Mehmet, who is Vice Chairman of Migration Watch and one of Britain's first ambassadors from an ethnic minority, and the political activist and head of British Future Sunder Katwala. The event is hosted by Night Waves presenter Philip Dodd, and recorded as part of Radio 3's Free Thinking Festival 2012. The Free Thinking festival of ideas takes place at The Sage Gateshead Friday 2 - Sunday 4 November and is broadcast for three weeks on Radio 3 from Friday 2 November. Show less
