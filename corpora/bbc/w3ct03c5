Shine On You Crazy Diamond by Pink Floyd is said to have been written about Syd Barrett, their former band member. It is both a tribute, and a call for him to ‘shine on’ despite suffering serious mental health issues. David Gilmour, the voice and guitar of Pink Floyd, recalls the day that Syd unexpectedly appeared in the studio where they were recording Wish You Were Here, the album bookended by Shine On. Nobody recognised him at first; once handsome and slender, he had gained weight and shaved his head and eyebrows. Shine On You Crazy Diamond has a special place in many people's lives. Anna Gascoigne talks about the pain of losing her son, Jay. He was a gentle boy, a talented musician, who eventually succumbed to the multiple mental health problems he had battled for years. For Anna, Shine On You Crazy Diamond speaks directly to her of Jay; he loved Pink Floyd, and Shine On was played at his memorial service. Anna herself was driven to the brink of suicide by her son’s death. British DJ Ed Steelefox describes a New Year’s Eve house party, where, as the guests gradually fell asleep, he chose to slip out the door leaving a non-stop playlist of different live versions of Shine On You Crazy Diamond to penetrate their dreams. And professor Allan Moore takes to the grand piano to play and talk about what it is in the track that is so directly reminiscent of Syd Barrett. (Photo: Pink Floyd, pictured in 1972.
