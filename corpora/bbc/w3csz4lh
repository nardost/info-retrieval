Rashid Khan was born in Nangarhar in Eastern Afghanistan in 1998 but his early life was spent in a refugee camp in Pakistan away from the conflict that has swept across his homeland for decades. He grew up playing cricket with his ten siblings eventually returning to Afghanistan to complete his schooling. And now, just a few years later called ‘Afghanistan’s googly master’ and named for the second year running as the leading Twenty20 cricketer in the world Rashid Khan is a household name in cricket the world over, and a national hero in Afghanistan. Suddenly Afghanistan is a cricketing nation on the world stage. Is Khan really the finest spin bowler on the planet? Hameed Qayoomi of the BBC Afghan Service also grew up in a Pakistan refugee camp and has followed Khan’s career from the start. He and Khan talk frankly about what it means to be Afghan in the twenty first century, to be refugees close to home. And a host of cricketing greats analyse those magic fingers.
