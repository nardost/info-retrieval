Chinese Billionaire Chen Guangbiao is one of the new breed of self-made billionaires who've become super rich through China's remarkable economic revolution. He already donates half of his profits to charity and has recently pledged to follow the lead of American billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett by giving away all his money when he dies. He tells Matthew Bannister what motivates his generosity and why his family still work to earn their living. Nigerian Environmentalist Nnimmo Bassey grew up during Nigeria's brutal civil war of the 1960s. The violence he witnessed made him determined to devote the rest of his life to challenging injustice in his country. He is now a leading Nigerian environmental campaigner and has just won a Right Livelihood Award, sometimes known as the alternative Nobel Prize. He tells Matthew about being arrested and imprisoned in an overcrowded cell and how he has sacrificed a stable family life for his work. Show less
