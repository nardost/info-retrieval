Would you hire someone to impersonate one of your relatives? Yuichi Ishii is a former actor who runs Family Romance, a 'family rental' business in Japan. He pretends to be people's fathers, husbands and ex-lovers. Over nine years, he's played spouse to a hundred women and organised 8,000 fake weddings. But, it's an ethical minefield when you're living a lie. Image: Japanese anime fan poses with his virtual reality wife Credit: Getty Images Presenter: Saskia Edwards Producer: Maryam Maruf Show less
