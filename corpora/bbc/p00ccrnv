This week on the Forum… why what we see and hear can affect our well being. Leading mind and body medical researcher Esther Sternberg explains how our environment can make or break the healing process. Futuristic fiction set in Africa. Nigerian American novelist Nnedi Okorafor makes the case for sci-fi as a new way to shine a light on African problems. And the future of food consumption. Dutch behavioural ecologist Marcel Dicke argues we should all learn to like the taste of insects – however whiskery or slimy they may be. Insects are a more efficient way to provide food rich in protein, for the world’s growing population.
