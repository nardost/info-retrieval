Martine Wright lost both her legs in the 2005 London bombings. Twelve years on, she's made a remarkable recovery and even competed in the London 2012 Paralympics. Her book is called 'Unbroken'. Ellen Ochoa may have been the first Hispanic American woman to fly in space, but the astronaut was also the first person to play the flute on the space shuttle. Yi Jiefang's son loved nature.
