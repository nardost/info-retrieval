Lawrence Levy is a London-born Harvard law graduate who had spent most of his career working in California's Silicon valley, the home of some of the biggest technology companies in the world. In 1994 he was contacted by Steve Jobs to help rescue a small computer company called Pixar. Lawrence helped turn the company around which went on to make billions of dollars and a long list of classic film titles. This piece contains audio clips from the film Toy Story, directed by John Lasseter. Gunter Demnig is a German artist who has been laying brass-covered cobblestones across 21 countries in Europe. Each stone is inscribed with a person's name, date of birth and place of death. Gunter has laid most of the 60-thousand stones, each one commemorating a Jewish victim of Nazi persecution between 1933 and 1945. Brazilian Antonio Vicente bought a barren patch of land in 1973 and decided to grow a forest. Most people called him crazy and said he was wasting his time and money but Antonio kept planting trees and has now planted 50,000 of them in his very own rainforest. In the city of Jiangyin, in Eastern China, Li Yongguo runs an organisation helping families he says were separated as a result of poverty in the 1960s and '70s. He hosts events for people searching for their relatives and also arranges DNA testing in order to reunite abandoned children with their parents. (Picture: Lawrence Levy.
