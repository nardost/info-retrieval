Tony Steele is 78 years old and has spent his life delighting audiences with his daring stunts on the flying trapeze. Following surgery for a blood clot on the brain, he is back in the air with 52 stitches in his head. British poet Christopher Reid lost his wife Lucinda to cancer 10 years ago. His loss inspired him to write an anthology of poems called A Scattering. The book became a best seller and won a major literary award - something he thinks his wife would have been very proud of. Twenty-one-year-old Kenyan Caren Odanga has just been given a young leaders award by Queen Elizabeth in London.
