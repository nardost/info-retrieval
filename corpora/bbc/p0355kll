Sarah Cecilie Finklestein Waters grew up on the run with her father. When she was four years old her father abducted her from her home in Norway and took her to the USA. Sarah, with the Charity PACT, has now made a film about her experience. The real life story of the Chinese ballet dancer Li Cunxin reads like the script for a Hollywood movie. Li was one of 7 brothers, born in 1961 into an illiterate peasant family in a remote farming community in North Eastern China. He was plucked from his school to attend Madam Mao's Beijing dance academy and became a renowned ballet star. His dramatic defection to the USA in 1979 caused an international incident. When he retired from dancing Li became a successful stockbroker in Australia but has recently been appointed artistic director of the Queensland ballet. When Lawrence Afere graduated from university with a degree in business, his family expected him to use his skills to make a fortune in the city but Lawrence had other ideas. He returned to his hometown of Akure in southwest Nigeria and became a farmer. Not only that, he decided he would encourage other young people to do the same. Lawrence founded an organisation called Springboard that's giving young people in one of Nigeria's poorest areas a piece of farm land and the opportunity of a decent career. The Xikrin tribe live deep in the Amazon rainforest, nine hours by boat from the nearest city in the state of Par√° in the north of Brazil. The Xikrin were nearly wiped out by disease in the 1960s - and now they say they are are facing a new threat to their future from the construction of the giant Belo Monte dam. Our reporter Gibby Zobel took a flight to meet the Xikrin people. (Picture: Sarah Cecilie. Credit: Parents and Abducted Children Together) Show less
