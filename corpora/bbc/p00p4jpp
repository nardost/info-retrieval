Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, we meet Rahel Zegeye, a former maid determined to warn other young Ethiopian women against ending up in a life of virtual slavery. She discovered that working for a family thousands of miles from home - in her case in Lebanon - can be far from idyllic. She secretly made a film to highlight the dangers involved. Also today, Lucy Ash talks to a lesbian police officer and a notorious bank robber who've formed an unusual friendship. And, as part of our Edible City series, we introduce you to Danish cook Bronte Aurel, who tells us why, for her, a bite of smoked mackerel is a taste of home. Show less
