Seventy-nine year old Hilde Schramm is the daughter of Hitler's architect, Albert Speer - something she has struggled with all her life. She became a driving force in the German peace movement and the fledgling Green party. She has also been very involved in efforts to combat racism, and now, in the wake of the conflict in Syria, has opened her home to refugees. Outlook's Abby d'Arcy went to meet her and two of her Syrian lodgers, Nizar and Ahmad. Petina Gappah, a Zimbabwean lawyer turned award-winning writer talks about her first novel, The Book of Memory - a vivid portrait of Zimbabwe as seen by a prisoner on death row. Thayane Tavares, the Brazilian schoolgirl who was shot four times when a gunman opened fire in her classroom in Rio de Janeiro in 2011. Four years on, she is still in a wheelchair, and tells us how she has learnt to live without her legs - and why she now wants to become a police chief. Mihail Vasiliadis, the editor of Apogevmatin - the last Greek language newspaper produced in Istanbul, which, along with his son, he hand delivers to the city's now depleted Greek community.
