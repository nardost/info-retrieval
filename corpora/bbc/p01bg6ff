Cutting-edge space science from this year's Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado. Former astronaut Edward Lu explains why we urgently need to map all sizeable near-Earth orbit asteroids if we want to avoid becoming 'dinosaur toast'. Also, Lisa Randall, a theoretical physicist at Harvard, explores the mysteries of dark matter - the invisible, seemingly inert stuff, which is thought to account for about a quarter of the mass-energy of the known universe. And Fermilab's Craig Hogan is behind a new experiment to probe the fabric of space itself, by seeing if it's possible to detect the very tiniest units in the universe.
