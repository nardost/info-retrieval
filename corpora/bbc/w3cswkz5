From being a drug-addicted teenager living on the streets of London to directing documentaries for the big screen, Lorna Tucker has trodden an unusual path to success. Having realised a passion for telling other people’s stories, she’s now telling her own extraordinary tale. What is life like in a ghost town? Karin Montali is one of the last handful of inhabitants of Camerino, a small town in central Italy that was almost completely destroyed by an earthquake in 2016. As a young man, Aaron Long donated to a sperm bank. Twenty years later, he decided to find out if he had any children and his search revealed far more than he expected. This is the curious story of the family that formed backwards. (Image: Lorna Tucker. Courtesy of Lorna Tucker.) Show less
