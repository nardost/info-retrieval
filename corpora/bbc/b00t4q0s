We are told that life presents us with myriad choices. Like products on a supermarket shelf, our jobs, our relationships, our bodies and our identities are all there for the choosing. We are encouraged to 'be ourselves', but the pressure to make those choices can lead to enormous anxiety. In a new study Renata Selacl researches dating sites, self help books and people's relationship to celebrity, and uncovers the complexities involved in the choices we make and how they often lead to disquiet. In Thinking Allowed on 28 July, Laurie Taylor explores whether we have too much choice in our lives. Also, a new study from Norwegian Sociologist Sveinung Sandberg looks at the life skills that Oslo drug dealers acquire and explores whether operating from within a welfare state is very different from the street life of dealers in the USA.
