In 1979, English sailor Nick Ward found himself in the middle of the biggest disaster in ocean racing. He was in the crew of the Grimalkin, one of 303 yachts taking part in the Fastnet Challenge Cup – a demanding 608-mile race around the south-west coast of the British Isles. The course started in fine weather but ended up in unimaginable horror after a freak storm swept into the Celtic Sea and pounded Nick’s boat. The ensuing rescue operation was the UK’s largest since World War 2 – and Nick was the last man to be saved. He tells his story to Emily Webb. Of mourning and mushrooms - how grieving Malaysian widow, Long Litt Woon, found solace in fungi foraging after the death of her husband. She's now become a certified mushroom expert.
