Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today Nik Wallenda, the man who made history by walking across Niagara Falls on a high wire. He is the seventh generation of the tightrope dynasty known as the Flying Wallendas. Also the Colombian teacher who looks after the exotic animals abandoned by drug barons.
