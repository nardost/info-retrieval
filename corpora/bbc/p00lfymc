Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan MÃ©ndez talks about his own imprisonment and torture during the "Dirty War" of the 1970s in his native Argentina. Now he says he's happy to dedicate his life to the elimination of torture worldwide. We meet Zenichi Kawasaki who lost his wife and many of his friends in the tsunami that rocked the east coast of Japan earlier this year. His only consolation was discovering the house he had built was the only one left standing in the area. We also hear from Carlo Alban, the teenage actor who appeared in the American TV series, Sesame Street, despite being an illegal immigrant. And lastly the feisty 17-year old Afghan woman who's taken up boxing - a sport previously banned by the Taliban. She's teaching disrespectful men a lesson. Show less
