Walter Murch is a superstar sound designer, who's worked on some of Hollywood's biggest films like The Godfather trilogy and Apocalypse Now. His work has immersed audiences in everything from the clattering trains of New York to the rhythmic helicopter rotors of the Vietnam war. Walter's avant-garde production techniques have changed the way cinema sounds. His story is featured in the documentary, Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound. He spoke to Outlook's Emily Webb. Dr. Mala Srikanth was a successful military doctor before she was severely injured in a car accident. She turned to knitting to help recover her finger movement and now works with a community of women knitters in the hills of northern India.
