Last Broadcast Date: Wed 7 May 2014
Ahmed Khatir took up a camera rather than a gun to report on the forgotten conflict in the Nuba Mountains of Sudan. We also hear from American Ryan Boyette, based in Sudan, who founded the organisation which trained Ahmed. Tanja Mihhailova is Estonia's entrant in this year's Eurovision Song Contest. She's also a member of Estonia's Russian-speaking minority. British writer Diana Darke bought an old house in Damascus which has now become a refuge for Syrians sheltering from the civil war. Her book is called My House in Damascus: An Inside View of the Syrian Revolution. Picture: Ahmed Khatir, citizen journalist in the Nuba Mountains Show less
