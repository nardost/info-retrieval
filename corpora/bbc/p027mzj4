Marking 20 years after the end of apartheid, BBC reporter Stanley Kwenda travels to Orania in South Africa to find out why Afrikaners in this remote town choose to live apart from other communities. Stanley hears how Orania started life as a government construction camp for people working on a dam nearby. It was bought in 1991 by a group of Afrikaners who believed they were marginalised in post-apartheid South Africa and wanted their homeland to preserve their culture. However, Orania has close links to the family of Hendrik Verwoerd – the man who introduced apartheid – and, as a consequence, the town is now seen by many as a final outpost of apartheid. Stanley Kwenda talks to some of Orania’s residents, including Carel Boshoff – the son of Orania’s founder – who claims that the community is simply looking after its people and interests. As a black Zimbabwean, Stanley explores whether the people of Orania are clinging to a racist past – or whether it is a close-knit community that just happens to be white.
