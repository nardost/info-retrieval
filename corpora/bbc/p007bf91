Salman Ahmad and Junoon The Urdu word junoon means obsessive passion, which is how Pakistan-born Salman Ahmad feels about music, and why he chose that name for his rock band. Salman tells Outlook's Matthew Bannister about a life divided between Pakistan and America, East and West, and how both worlds have influenced his life, beliefs and music. Salman Ahmad's autobiography is called "Rock and Roll Jihad", and it's published by Simon and Schuster. Show less
