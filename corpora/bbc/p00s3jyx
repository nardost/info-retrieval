Some Himalayan glaciers have actually grown during the past decades, according to a report in the journal Nature Geoscience. The impact of climate change on the iconic mountain range is shrouded in controversy - particularly after widespread claims that they would disappear by 2035 were proved false. The area that is showing signs of glacial growth is relatively small - but the news adds to the sense of confusion. Photographer Klaus Thymann from Project Pressure travelled to the region to document the glaciers, but as well as taking his cameras, he took along a One Planet recorder and met a few of the scientists trying to get better data from the mountains. Also in the show, another environmental photographer - Mark Edwards - gives us a tour of his latest exhibition. One Planet first met Mark two and a half years ago when his Hard Rain exhibition was touring the world ahead of COP15. We meet again, at the same location, but different pictures, to ask if anything significant has changed since our first meeting. As ever, tune in, have a listen and then let us know what you think.
