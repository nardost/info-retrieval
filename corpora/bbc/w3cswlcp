Imagine surviving a plane crash, only to be faced with the threat of wild jaguars and piranha infested waters? Minor Vidal was the sole survivor of a tragedy that engrossed the Bolivian press, and captivated the nation. Rashmi Becker is a British dancer who set up Step Change Studio, a dance company for both disabled and non-disabled performers. She was inspired to do it after realising how dance helped her severely disabled brother. Jim Obergefell fell in love, and ended up changing the course of American legal history; hear how he did it in this fascinating interview with Outlook reporter Saskia Edwards.
