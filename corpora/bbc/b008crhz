GLOBALIZATION Laurie Taylor talks to Nobel prize-winner Joseph E. Stiglitz, one of the world’s most influential economists, who was Chief Economist at the World Bank until January 2000, before that President Clinton’s Chief Advisor on Economic Affairs. Professor Stiglitz discusses the rapidly accelerating process of globalisation and the increasing problems that it is likely to cause the world. He explains how, despite the mismanagement of the project and discrimination against countries in the developing world, he has confidence that we have what it takes to make globalisation work.
