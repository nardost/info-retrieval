SOCIOLOGY OF SMELL In their new book The Guide to Perfumes Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez examine the sociology of smell from its aesthetic complexity, to its class, status associations, racial overtones and its gender implication. Laurie Taylor is joined by the fragrance expert Luca Turin, who describes perfume as an art, and Rod Watson, a sociologist of smell, to explore the hidden resonances of perfume.
