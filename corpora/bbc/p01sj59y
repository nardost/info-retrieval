Five years ago in Pakistan the family home of journalist Kareem Khan was hit by a missile in a drone strike, killing his eldest son and his brother - he is now taking both the CIA and the Pakistani government to court. Kareem tells Jo Fidgen what it is like living under the threat of drone attacks. In this year's Winter Olympics in Sochi three Canadian sisters from the Dufour-Lapointe family all competed in the freestyle skiing mogul finals. Two of them - Justine and Chloe - won gold and silver medals. They tell reporter Melanie Brown about the family fascination with skiing. American Kurt Thometz runs a bookshop on the ground floor of his home in Harlem, New York. Its shelves are dedicated to works of African-American literature - a surprising outcome because Kurt was brought up to be racist. Outlook's reporter Matthew Nelson visits him in his intriguing little shop. Irish novelist Hugo Hamilton tells Jo Fidgen about a trip he made to Berlin to fulfil the wishes of a dying friend. The famous writer, Nuala O'Faolin had just a few weeks left to live, and wanted to make one final journey. Hugo talks about his memories of that adventure and why he turned the experience into a novel. (Picture: Kareem Khan (Left) with Outlook presenter Jo Fidgen) Show less
