Colombian Natalia Ponce de Leon's life changed the day she was attacked with acid. She then started a campaign to ensure justice for other survivors. Five hundred free concerts in five years. That's been the goal of Tanzanian folk singer Vitali Maembe. His songs highlight the problems of corruption, and he has taken his message to villages throughout the country. Jay Poudyal is a Nepali photographer who's become something of a hero to some of those who suffered in last year's catastrophic earthquake. He couldn't be more surprised. Just a few years ago, Jay's life seemed to be hitting the skids. He'd moved to Australia, and was drinking very heavily. Alson Kelen is a master boat builder from the Marshall Islands, a nation of 53-thousand people spread over a thousand islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. He's is hoping to pass on his own skills as a master boat builder and sailor to the next generation. (Picture: Natalia Ponce de Leon. Credit: EPA/Mauricio Dueñas Castañeda.) Show less
