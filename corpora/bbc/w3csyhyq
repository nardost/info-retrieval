When Wesley Hamilton was in his early 20s he was unhappy, overweight, and dealing drugs. Then, just after he turned 24 and got custody of his daughter, he was shot by a stranger. Wesley survived but his injuries left him paralysed. As the years went on, he was able to get fit and healthy, even becoming a bodybuilding champion and starting a charity called Disabled...but not really. And last year he came face to face with his attacker – and thanked him. Wesley tells Emily Webb why getting shot was “the best thing that ever happened to me.” Freweini Mebrahtu is an Ethiopian businesswoman and period pioneer.
