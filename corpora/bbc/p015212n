*** This programme was broadcast on 15 February 2013 *** In a surprise announcement the present Pope has declared his intention to stand down by the end of this month. Pope Benedict's decision might have huge ramifications for the church, with speculation that a non-European could be elected by the Cardinals to take his place. It is a time when issues of faith and doctrine are to the fore, and when the church's own conduct has been under scrutiny.
