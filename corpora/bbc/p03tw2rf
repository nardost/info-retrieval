Razia Jan, a former businesswoman turned educator talks about her mission to help girls in the country get an education. She built a school in a village which had never provided any learning for girls at all, and her challenge was to persuade local men to allow their daughters to attend. Sam Lee is the London-born folk singer who has become a guardian for the ancient songs of traveller communities in the British Isles. For 10 years, he has been gathering songs and stories which are in danger of dying out and recording new versions of them - with host of global instruments including Scandinavian Willow Flute, Japanese Koto and Indian Shruti box - with his band the Friends. Jenny Neyman and Chris Hanna, an American couple talk about their romantic Alaskan ski trip that went horribly wrong. After a pleasant morning on the slopes, they got caught in an unexpected snow storm and had to dig a snow cave where they sheltered for three days.
