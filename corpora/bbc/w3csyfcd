After growing up in Singapore, Margaret Leng Tan became the first woman to earn a doctorate from the Juilliard School of Music in the US. Her career then shrank to a place she didn't expect when she became the world’s first professional toy piano virtuoso. Outlook’s Tara Gadomski went to meet her and and her 30 miniature pianos. Lo Man Kam is a Kung Fu master who practises a style of the martial art known as Wing Chun. As a teenager, he even trained with the screen legend Bruce Lee. Although he's now in his late 80s, people still travel from around the world to take his classes. Image: Eunice (in stripped dress) and Helen Cooper (with sunglasses) Credit: Helene Cooper Show less
