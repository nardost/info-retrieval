Dr Mae Jemison is a pioneering astronaut, medical doctor, engineer and dancer, who became the first woman of colour to go into space in 1992 on board the Endeavour shuttle mission. As a child growing up in Chicago Dr Jemison imagined exploring the universe. Today she's encouraging young people to follow in her footsteps with the 'Earth We Share' international science camp and has made it her mission to get humans travelling beyond our solar system within the next 100 years with the '100-Year Starship' project.
