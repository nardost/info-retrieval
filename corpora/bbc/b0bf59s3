Last Broadcast Date: Fri 17 Aug 2018
Towards the end of his comic rant about the descent of man, Simon Evans does something very dangerous. He starts to read out to his audience an extract of John Stuart Mill. Potential comedy death? In this programme he explains why the famous Victorian philosopher with the squirly hair is his idea of genius. As well as On Liberty, Mill wrote The Subjection of Women and was the first member of Parliament to call for women's right to vote. Joining him and Matthew Parris is Professor Anne Phillips of the London School of Economics. Simon Evans' latest show is Genius 2.0. He hosts Simon Evans Goes to Market on Radio 4. The producer in Bristol is Miles Warde. Show less
