Between 1981 and 1990 teams 'representing' England, Sri Lanka, West Indies and Australia toured Apartheid era South Africa, despite there being a well established sporting boycott in place. Those that chose to tour were well rewarded financially, but faced damaging consequences to their careers and reputations. Thirty years later Jonathan Agnew, the BBC's cricket correspondent, reveals how and why the tours took place and finds out whether those that chose to play in these rebel cricket tours now regret their actions. Interviewees include Sir Vivian Richard, John Emburey, Richard Ellison, Franklyn Stephenson and Clive Rice.
