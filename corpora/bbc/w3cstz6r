For the past year, gynaecologist Dr Marzia Salam Yaftali has been running the last-standing, public hospital in the Afghan city of Kunduz. The city has long been dangerous, but the stakes were especially high in 2015 when the Taliban attempted to recapture it. Marzia tells Outlook's Emily Webb about living through the siege. Tudor Lakatos is a teacher from a small village in northern Romania but he's better known as Elvis Romano. He performs Elvis songs in the Roma language, on a mission to share Roma culture with the world. In Rio de Janeiro violence between armed criminal gangs is on the rise and many schools are trapped in the crossfire. Music teacher Roberto Ferreira has developed an inspiring way to keep his primary school children calm. Sammi Grant is an American dialect coach whose job it is to help actors get every accent right, from Filipino to Russian. She's visually impaired and says it helps her master different voices.
