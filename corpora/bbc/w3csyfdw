The BBC Inspirations Awards is back. Today on Outlook, we’re launching the 2020 edition of our search to find the world’s unsung heroes – people who have shown remarkable courage and resilience to improve their lives, or the lives of their community. We want your help in the search for this year’s winners. All this week, we’ll be hearing from past winners and nominees - and we hope their stories will inspire you to nominate your unsung heroes. Nice Leng’ete is a Maasai woman from Kenya. When she was eight years old, she was set to be circumcised. The circumcision was not only highly dangerous, but would also spell the end of her education. Nice begged her grandfather to postpone what she calls ‘the cut’ – and then determinedly set about persuading village elders to drop the practice. Jo Fidgen first heard Nice’s amazing story in 2018 - the same year she became one of our three winners. Two years later, Jo catches up with Nice, and hears about her new project, ‘Nice Place’, a shelter for women and girls at risk of gender-based violence, and a training centre. Alison Cope is a 2018 BBC Inspirations Awards nominee. Alison is the mother of the rapper Joshua Ribera, aka Depzman, who was murdered a few weeks after his debut album reached number on iTunes. He was just 17. When Depzman’s fans arrived to Alison’s house devastated by the news of his death, Alison decided to grieve with them.
