KILLINGS IN COLOMBIA Jose Giraldo was shot dead four and a half years ago on his small farm outside Cali in Colombia. The suspect is a soldier. Human rights groups have documented thousands of cases over the past decade where soldiers have killed civilians and then lied that the victims were guerilla fighters. Earlier this month, seven Colombian soldiers were convicted of murdering a civilian. But such cases seldom come to court. Jose Giraldo's daughter Martha explains why she is determined to get justice for her father. KURDISH CHILDREN'S LIFE ON FILM When Saddam Hussein launched genocidal gas attacks on Iraq's Kurdish population in 1988, the village of Goptapa lost many of its people. The memory of that attack hangs over the place and has been passed onto the children. A filmmaker from Northern Ireland, Mark Cousins, wanted to see how it had affected the youngsters' imagination and gave them cameras to shoot their own videos. Mark tells Jo Fidgen all about the film he has made as a result. DOT FISHER SMITH Dot Fisher-Smith has spent the last forty-odd years of her life protesting. An American, it was the Vietnam war that initially got her fired up. She campaigned against the draft, was promptly arrested, and never looked back. For years her life was dominated by civil action and in her late sixties she became a poster girl for those opposed to the logging industry when she chained herself to a truck. Now aged 82, a documentary about her life is being released in her home town. She tells Jo Fidgen about her life as a protester. Show less
