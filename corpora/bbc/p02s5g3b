Agnes Igoye's childhood in Uganda was overshadowed by the brutality of Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army. The rebel group is notorious for abducting children and making them commit atrocities. These days Agnes is an employee of the immigration service, and uses her knowledge of the LRA to identify fighters and their victims. One of the people she's caught is a wanted LRA commander. Idris Khan is a British artist who produces multiple photographs that he pieces together to achieve an abstract effect. His work is inspired by the Islamic rituals practised by his Pakistani father. The BBC's Samira Ahmed has been to meet him. When Philippe Pozzo di Borgo lost the use of all his limbs after a paragliding accident twenty two years ago, a young Algerian former gang leader called Abdel Sellou became his carer. The story of their unusual friendship was turned into a hit film called The Untouchables and now Philippe has written a book Toi et Moi, J'y Crois reflecting on his life since the accident.
