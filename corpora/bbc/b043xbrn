Old soldier wanted to be buried where his band of brothers met up with the Russians in 1945 - when they were our allies. This archive edition of Letter from America was recorded by one of two listeners, who between them taped and labelled over 650 Letter From America programmes from 1973 to 1989. It was restored by the BBC in 2014. Show less
