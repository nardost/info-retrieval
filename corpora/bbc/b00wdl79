On Last Word this week: Sir Peter Wakefield, British diplomat in Cairo during the Suez crisis and in Libya during the coup which brought Colonel Gaddafi to power. Bill White, who studied human skeletons to reveal our history, and kept hundreds of bones in his garage TV comedy producer and director Douglas Argent who brought us classics like "The Liver Birds" and "Till Death Us Do Part". Warren Mitchell pays tribute. Samuel Cohen who invented the neutron bomb, which he described as a "sane and moral weapon". And Peter Hofmann, the German tenor who made his name as a sexy Siegmund in Wagner's Ring, but made his money by covering easy listening standards. Show less
