American playwright Eve Ensler is best known for writing the international sensation The Vagina Monologues, a ground-breaking celebration of women's bodies. The play, which has been performed in more than 140 countries, has broken taboos and brought audiences to laughter and to tears around the world. Eve’s latest work is equally shocking – but in a very different way. It's a book written as a letter addressed to Eve by her father, in which he apologises for the way he abused her throughout her childhood. Eve told Outlook’s Jo Fidgen how writing the book helped her come to terms with the trauma. Latvian piano builder, David Klavins, has built the world's tallest piano.
