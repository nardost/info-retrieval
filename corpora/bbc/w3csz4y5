You Are My Sunshine - the 1930s country song has morphed from political slogan into a childrenâ€™s favourite. It has since been recorded by more than 400 artists from Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash to Aretha Franklin and Bryan Ferry. A mother and daughter explain how the song helped the daughter's recovery after a catastrophic car crash. Music brings meaning to our lives. From first breath to last rites music is there, helping us to deal with our emotions and reflect on our experiences. Be it solace or celebration, grief, love, lost youth or contented aging, we find ourselves reflected in the music we love and share. Soul Music takes a piece of music and talk to people for whom it has a special place in their lives. (Photo: From left: Jimmie Davis, Veda Ann Borg, 1949. Credit: Getty Images) Show less
