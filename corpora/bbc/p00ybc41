This week, the lift - millions of us use this piece of machinery every day but barely give it a second thought. But the lift, or elevator, is an intriguing place where strange things seem to happen to us. In today's programme, Mike Williams looks at the history of the lift, why we seem to behave so oddly inside them and why Hollywood has made the lift such a scene of disaster.
