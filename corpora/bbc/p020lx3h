American geologist John All fell twenty metres down a crevasse on a research trip to the Himalayas and managed to video himself. Despite five broken ribs, a broken right arm and a dislocated shoulder, he inched himself out, crawled to his tent, and posted a status update on his Facebook page - which led, eventually, to him being rescued. Brothers William and Michael Dunlop from Northern Ireland come from a family of motorcycle road racing champions. Tragically, both their father and uncle died whilst racing. A new documentary film called Road tells the family's story. Dutch student Boyan Slat has come up with a plan to rid the world's oceans of plastic waste. Experts are taking him seriously and he recently presented a feasibility study in New York. Writer Julia Franck shares the trauma and unhappiness of a childhood spent first in Communist East Germany and then in the West. Her book is called Back To Back.
