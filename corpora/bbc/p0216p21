Iraq is in crisis. Sunni Islamic extremists have taken over major cities in the north of the country, and are fighting hard. There are reports of summary executions and other serious human rights violations. Meanwhile the Shia-led government is being offered help by Iran, which some in the West - even the US government might welcome. So how did this crisis develop? Is this a moment of fundamental strategic realignment? And what does it mean for the Iraqi people, for the region - and for the rest of the world? Owen Bennett-Jones and some of the BBC's best-placed correspondents tackle these questions in a lively discussion.
