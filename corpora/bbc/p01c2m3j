***Some listeners may find parts of this programme upsetting*** If by accident you are thrown into icy waters, what can you do to help your chances of survival? As Professor of Survival and Thermal Medicine, Michael Tipton, explains, there are a number of things that will help you, but they are surprisingly counter-intuitive. And it’s not just about what you do physically. Professor Dinesh Bhugra from the Institute of Psychiatry suggests that your attitudes to your family and wider community also play a crucial role. Perhaps that’s what spurred on Gulli, the real-life hero of Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur’s film The Deep, as he successfully braved the freezing waters of the North Atlantic for several hours.
