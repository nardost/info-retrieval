70 year-old Werner Strahl is a retired German doctor who heads a small aid organisation called Cap Anamur. They run a specialist children's hospital in Sierra Leone, which has become a model of its kind in West Africa. Werner is based in Germany, but he was visiting the hospital in August this year, as the Ebola virus was spreading towards the capital, Freetown. And when a four-year-old boy came in with symptoms of Ebola, he was unprepared for what happened next. Armando Fonseca is a 56-year-old independent travel agent in Rio de Janeiro. He has many loyal customers and has won an award for his impeccable service. What's unusual about Armando is that he has never used a computer. Anton Foek went to see for himself how Armando manages a 21st century business with the same technology he started out with in the 1980s. Phil Hansen is an artist known for his unusual techniques. He's painted the Mona Lisa with hamburger grease, made a portrait of Barack Obama out of dead flies, and used peanut butter sandwiches to depict the Virgin Mary. But his unorthodox approach was borne out of necessity. Phil has a permanent shake in his hand that makes it difficult for him to hold steady a regular pen or brush. The Singer-songwriter came to prominence in the American folk music scene of the 1960s, and her songs became the soundtrack to the country's civil rights movement, and the Vietnam war protests. Today she's 73 years old, still supporting causes and still performing. And although her voice remains strong it has changed. She tells the BBC's John Wilson that it has recently given her some cause for concern. Show less
