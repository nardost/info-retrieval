Caver Vernon Unsworth helped coordinate what became known as 'the rescue of the century' when 12 Thai schoolboys and their coach became trapped in the Tham Luang caves in Northern Thailand last year. Vernon has spent the last seven years exploring the caves and knows them inside out. He advised the authorities to bring in experienced cave divers immediately. In the end it took 17 days to get the boys out. Vernon tells Jo Fidgen how they did it. Jong-So Lim is a 75-year-old grandma from South Korea. She started lifting weights to improve her health after she had problems with her back. Her coach wanted her to enter a bodybuilding competition, but that meant agreeing to wear a teeny tiny red bikini. She decided she had to do it! We hear from Jong-So Lim and her granddaughter Heewon Seo. Image: Caver Vernon Unsworth in Thailand's Tham Luang caves Credit: Vernon Unsworth Show less
