Nandini Das, one of Radio 3's New Generation Thinkers, gives a talk on the 16th Century craze for crime pamphlets, recorded at the Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival. Crime fiction and travel writing are regulars on the book charts today. But long before the charts were invented it was the crime pamphlet that seized the nation's imagination. Nandini Das explores the late sixteenth-century craze that revealed a new secret world to readers and became the first best-selling phenomenon of the popular press. The Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival takes place at The Sage Gateshead Friday 2 - Sunday 4 November and is broadcast for three weeks on Radio 3 from Friday 2 November. The New Generation Thinkers are winners of a talent scheme run by BBC Radio 3 and the Arts and Humanities Research Council to find the brightest academic minds in the arts and humanities with the potential to turn their ideas into broadcasts.
