Andrew Marr discusses money, transformation and the obsession with growth with two leading economists: Diane Coyle and Dharshini David. Professor Coyle argues it's time to rethink the way we measure productivity, while the broadcaster Dharshini David follows the journey of a single dollar in her study of globalisation. The theatre director Anna Ledwich is more interested in the people whose lives revolve around the money markets: her latest play Dry Powder highlights their vulnerability, vision and sheer unadulterated greed. During the financial crisis of 2008, Iceland experienced proportionally the largest banking collapse by any country in economic history. The novelist Jón Kalman Stefánsson is writing a modern Icelandic family saga and explores whether the transformation of his country in the 20th century laid the foundations for its future collapse.
