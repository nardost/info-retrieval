The Bamboo club was built for the people of St Pauls, in Bristol, England - the people who were victimised or not welcome elsewhere because of the colour of their skin. We hear from dozens of people who were members, musicians, or simply occasional visitors. They all share the same idea that there were two themes running through the club – community and music. We hear from those who set up the first black cricket team in Bristol, about the first meetings of the famous St Pauls Festival, and how the music was used for charity events to support local causes – regardless of colour. But it was the music that made this club so unique. There are memories from those who sat and spoke with a young Bob Marley, the sisters who grew up with Desmond Dekker, who then find him singing on the Bamboo stage the week he was UK number one, plus those who graced the stage themselves, including the last act to play the Bamboo before it (and all their kit) went up in flames.
