Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today we hear from game warden Paul Onyango. He says the Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo is becoming almost like a war zone, as local poachers have been replaced by militant groups from neighbouring countries. These militias are slaughtering elephants on an unprecedented scale, lured by the rich rewards currently on offer for ivory. Also, we meet Philomena Lynott, the mother of the Irish rock band Thin Lizzy's late lead singer Phil Lynott. An unmarried teenage mother who gave birth to a mixed-race child in intolerant post-War Britain, she had to face the death of her famous rock star son from the effects of heroin addiction when he was just 36. She's written a book about him called My Boy - The Philip Lynott Story (published by Hot Press Books). Show less
