Ten years since 9/11, the Forum contemplates the role of memory, shared and private, visual and literary. Bridget Kendall's guests are: photographer Dorothy Bohm, whose remarkable photographs have captured the lives of ordinary people worldwide over seven decades; physician turned philosopher Raymond Tallis, who argues that memory remains a mystery, which neuroscience has still not been able to fathom; and Russian-born writer and broadcaster Zinovy Zinik, whose latest book explores the way our pasts can be embellished or even invented.
