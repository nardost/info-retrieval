Liberian politician Saah Joseph tells how he imported six second hand ambulances from the US to improve his country's health system and help in the fight against ebola. He transported them to Monrovia, and recruited a team of drivers. Saah has even become a part-time ambulance driver himself. Swiss explorer Sarah Marquis has walked 10,000 miles in the last three years, journeying from the icy cold of Siberia, across China, Laos and Thailand, to the blistering heat of Australia. She describes how she started exploring as an eight-year old. Mother of three, Ibu Jamaliah relates the emotional story of how she has been re-united with her children ten years after they were swept away in the Indian Ocean tsunami. Jamaliah was at home with her family at their home in Aceh province when the tsunami struck Indonesia. The devastating power of the wave separated father Septi and mother Jamaliah from two of their three children, but miraculously in August of this year, an extraordinary chain of events led to both missing children being re-united with their parents. 48 year old American sales executive Brian Robinson thinks that the New York subway is the ideal place to meet women. He spent 10 years chatting up women on his ride to work and says that he met over 500 and slept with quite a few of them. Brian, who is now happily married, has published a book revealing the secret of his technique. Photo: Saah Jospeh, Ibu Jamaliah and Brian Robinson. Show less
