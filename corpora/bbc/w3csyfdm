Italian Fishmonger Vittorio Fabris was inspired to sail from Venice to Nantucket by his favourite book, Moby Dick. But his epic voyage didn’t exactly go to plan. He faced storms and seriously damaged his boat along the way, keeping himself going with the company of music and dolphins. With his destination in sight, disaster struck - but Vittorio wouldn't give up on his dream. He tells Jo Fidgen his story. Where is the quietest place on earth? Gordon Hempton is a sound expert who studies natural environments and he has dedicated his life to finding out. He spoke to Mariana des Forges about how his journey took him to the middle of a volcano on a Pacific island, where it’s so quiet you can hear your own blood pumping. Beauty Queen turned media entrepreneur Basetsana Kumalo was the first woman to be crowned Miss South Africa after her country's first democratic elections. She was the first black contestant to win and became the face of South Africa’s new democracy. She spoke to Outlook’s Andile Masuku. Picture: Vittorio Fabris Credit: Fabio Fumagalli Show less
