SIMON DENG Simon Deng grew up in a small village in Southern Sudan and remembers a childhood of violence. He saw two of his friends shot dead and other villagers burned alive. Simon was just nine years old when he was kidnapped and given as a gift to a family in the north of Sudan. Later in life he went on to become a national swimming champion, before deciding to move to the United States. ISAAC JULIEN Six years ago, the British artist and filmmaker Isaac Julien started reading reports about 23 chinese migrants who had drowned whilst working as cockle pickers on Morecambe Bay in the North West of England. Over the following two years Julien collected articles about the tragedy and finally decided to create a new work about their story. He commissioned the Chinese poet Wang Ping to come with him to Morecambe Bay and to visit Shanghai and the remote province of Guangxi to research the culture of migration. Now his multi media work is about to go on show in London. ADELINA GARCIA 46-year-old Adelina Garcia is one of thousands of Peruvian women who have lost a loved-one in the country's bitter internal violence during the 1980s and 90s. Adelina's husband has been missing for nearly thirty years. And now she's joined up with other relatives of the "disappeared" to create a one kilometre long knitted "scarf of hope". This "knit-athon" has a special relevance because many of those who have been able to identify the remains of a relative have done so by recognising the knit or weave of the fabric clothing the body.
