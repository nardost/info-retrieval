Small time musicians from the American South shine a light on ambition, failure and the nature of success. This series paints a portrait of the American South where a few decades ago anyone could make their mark on posterity by paying a few hundred dollars to produce a vinyl record. Writer and DJ Joe Fletcher has amassed thousands of these largely religious records. He takes a trip along the back roads of the Deep South - tracking down the people who recorded records up to 50 years ago - to see how their lives have developed. In this three-part series Joe meets a cast of real-life characters who reflect on their achievements and failures, and the reality of the American Dream. In Savannah, Georgia, Joe hears from Pastor Tim Daniels who recorded his song Homogenous Man in 1972 at The Roman Lantern nightclub in Atlanta. He gave up a promising career as a secular singer when he had a religious conversion. He then dedicated his life to Jesus and took to the road singing Christian songs in various churches. After many years on the road he has now settled back in his home town, Savannah. He is the pastor of the non-denominational Life Church of the Islands, with a mixed congregation - both black and white people attend. In South Carolina Joe meets two of the remaining members of the Ramada Singers - LC Jacobs and James Johnson - who had commercial success with their first album Simon Peter. They toured all over the States but made very little money and eventually put their families first and returned home. As a result of Joe Fletcher's interest, the remaining members are planning a comeback. Southern Tracks is a look at the alternative side of the United Sates, a road trip through an overlooked part of the world's most powerful country. (Image: Joe Fletcher) Show less
