In the early 1990s, a successful young Dutch couple set off on a romantic holiday to the Vietnamese coast. But their plane crashed into a mountain and Annette Herfkens found herself deep in the Vietnamese jungle - injured and alone for 8 days. She describes how focusing on the beauty of the jungle, rather than her physical and emotional pain, helped her to survive. Annetteâ€™s book is called Turbulence: A True Story of Survival. Karen Igho Rakos, entered the Big Brother Africa house in 2011 and walked out a joint winner. Kim Chakanetsa has been speaking to Karen about how she ended up putting herself under the spotlight When Libya was plunged into turmoil with the revolution in 2011, many foreigners left the country quickly. Sometimes too quickly to take their beloved pets with them. Many turned to Jalal Kaal - a vet in the capital, Tripoli and asked him to help them out. Jalal and his assistant started a rescue operation that would test not only their resourcefulness, but put their lives at risk. Christine Sun Kim is a Korean-American sound artist - who's been deaf since birth. Her work challenges stereotypes about deafness, and questions the way in which we hear every day noises. Christine spoke to Jo Fidgen with the help of her sign language interpreter, Helsa Borinstein. Transmission audio has been changed to correctly describe the artist Christine Sun-Kim as American.
