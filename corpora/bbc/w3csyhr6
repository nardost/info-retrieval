In 1964 Theo Van Eijck was a cadet in the Dutch navy. He was unhappy with life in the military and wanted to get out to start over. But with 6 years still left on his service contract, he decided to steal military plane and make a run for it. He took off from Malta and managed to outrun three pursuing fighter jets and made it to Libya. After a week, he realised he had to go back. He made a deal with the Dutch Government and returned to a media storm and a short prison sentence. J.
