Diplomacy - what’s it for and how is it done? We present a user’s guide to the 'great game'. We hear about the tense negotiations and the rows, about the polite language and the secret code words used to deceive opponents. And we hear about cigars and lavish dinners and discover the importance of sandwiches. Presented by Mike Williams. (Image: A mixture of words relating to Diplomacy. BBC Copyright) Show less
