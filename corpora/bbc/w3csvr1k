British-Ethiopian poet Lemn Sissay focuses much of his work on his difficult upbringing. He grew up in foster care unaware of his real name and identity until he was an adult. Ignacio Montoya Carlotto was 36 years old when he made the shocking discovery that he had been at the centre of a national scandal in Argentina without knowing it. He is one of the hundreds of babies who had been snatched from their imprisoned mothers during the military regime in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He was now faced with a new family and the kind of fame he never asked for. Image: Baby rubber ducks following mum Credit: Getty Images Show less
