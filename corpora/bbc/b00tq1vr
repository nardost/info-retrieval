John Wilson presents Radio 4's obituary programme, analysing and reflecting on the lives of people who have recently died. This week: Lord Bingham, who rose to become the most senior and most respected judge in Britain. A former Master of the Rolls and Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham was a proud defender of individual liberty and human rights. Lord David Owen is among those paying tribute. We also hear about the heroism and bravery of wartime secret agent Eileen Nearne; the free-wheeling life of traveller and counter-cultural leader Sid Rawle; French new wave auteur Claude Chabrol and how Vladimir Raitz invented the package holiday 60 years ago.
