Matthew Sweet interviews Alberto Manguel about his new book, Curiosity, in which he tracks his life through the reading that has mapped his way, looking at Thomas Aquinas, David Hume, Lewis Carroll and Dante. As Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland turns 150 and a new exhibition opens at the Museum of Childhood in London, New Generation Thinker Naomi Paxton, and curator Kiera Vaclavik, consider the cultural impact of the Mad Hatter's Tea Party. And as Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd gets another big screen outing in a version starring Carey Mulligan, we ponder the Victorian writers who fall in and out of fashion in the modern era.
