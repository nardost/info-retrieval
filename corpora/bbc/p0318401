American Claressa Shields was one of the stars of the London Olympics in 2012. At the age of just seventeen, she won boxing gold as a middleweight. It was a long journey from street fighting in Flint in Michigan to the podium in London - and her story has now been turned into a film called, T-Rex, which is her professional nickname. She told Jo Fidgen how she came by it. German opera star Jonas Kaufmann is considered one of the finest tenors of his generation. He's performing at the Last Night of the Proms this month in London - and he's been giving Outlook's Nicki Paxman a flavour of the job - including one of the bizarre things he's been asked to do by a director. Shanta Chaudhary is from the Tharu community in Nepal, which has a long tradition of parents who sell or rent their children in exchange for land. Shanta spent 18 years as a bonded labourer for a succession of landlords. The practice is called Kamaiya - and was outlawed fifteen years ago after a campaign led by Shanta, among others. Since then, she's had a dramatic change in fortunes. Les Papiers Mouchoirs - or Paper Tissues in English - are a comedy trio from the Democratic Republic of Congo who have given themselves a tough audience. They specialise in making people laugh at funerals. Jo Fidgen talks to the leader of the troupe, Lamusasa Ekolo Junior to find out why they do it.
