Singer Charlotte Church travels to Kutaisi in Georgia to learn about Georgian polyphonic singing, a genre of music she is fascinated by. Situated on the border of Europe and Asia, Georgia has a strong history of Polyphonic singing, at celebrations as well as in everyday life, and was recognised by Unesco as a human masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage in 2001. A typical Georgian song is sung acappella by men, singing in at least three vocal ranges together. Charlotte who has sold more than 10 million records worldwide is from Llandaff, a district of Cardiff in Wales. She will be collaborating with a polyphonic choir in Kutaisi to create a new recording. Kutaisi has connections with Wales having been twinned with the town of Newport in Wales since 1989. The two countries are similar in size and population, both are mountainous with their own distinctive language and culture and both are strongholds of singing and rugby, a sport which has a considerable following in Kutaisi.
