South African Phindile Sithole-Spong was born HIV positive, but only found out when she was 19, after both her parents had died. She has been fighting against the stigma ever since, and she has recently started an organisation called Rebranding HIV - which aims to change the image of the virus among her generation of young Africans. On 22 September 1993, British student Tim Palmer was backpacking across America. He took an overnight train from New Orleans to Tallahassee - but at 3am, as the double decker train was approaching a bridge in Alabama, the train derailed. Forty-seven people died in the accident - but Tim tells us the story of his dramatic escape. The American singer-songwriter Barry Manilow has been writing hits for the past 40 years. They include Mandy, Copacabana and Can't Smile Without You. But his latest album takes him in a new direction. By the wonders of modern technology, Barry has recorded duets with his favourite singers from the past including Marilyn Monroe and Whitney Houston. All his singing partners on the new album have one thing in common: - they are dead. (Picture: South African candle bearing HIV/Aids red ribbon logo. Credit: Alexander Joe/AFP/Getty Images) Show less
