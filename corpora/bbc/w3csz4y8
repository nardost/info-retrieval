For Grammy award-winning artist John Legend, Bob Marleyâ€™s Redemption Song is an anthem for addressing the criminal justice system of America. 'Musicians without Borders' practitioner Ahmed al 'Azzeh finds the song inspires him to work towards a better life in the Palestinian Territories. And for Bob Scott, it will forever be heard in memory of his nephew Dominick who lost his life during the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004. Show less
