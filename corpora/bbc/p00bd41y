Best selling American novelist Audrey Niffenegger tells a cautionary tale about the perils of losing yourself in reading. A warning too from Australian historian Patrick Porter that military commanders should beware of stereotypes when it comes to sizing up the enemy. And a plea from Kenyan lawyer and activist Ory Okolloh not to stifle the creativity of African children, both in and out of school. Illustration by Audrey Niffenegger. Show less
