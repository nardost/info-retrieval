Photographer Juan Medina explains why he has spent the past 20 years following the stories of migrants trying to reach Europe by sea. Robin Johannsen, the American opera singer with a rare medical condition that means she has a chronically bad sense of direction - sometimes she can't even find her way on stage. Sesa Abu Daooh, the Egyptian woman who disguised herself as a man for 40 years to support her family after her husband died. Hakeem Wakur, the Arab Israeli dentist who's put his career on hold to become a professional wrestler. And Father Ray Kelly, the priest from Ireland whose singing voice has become an internet sensation.
