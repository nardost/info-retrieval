Jose Ramos Horta is considered one of Asia's greatest statesmen - he's helped his country East Timor win independence, he's won the Nobel Peace Prize, he's been a prime minister and a president, and he's survived an assassination attempt. In a very personal interview, he describes grappling with the everyday business of an ordinary life while making history. Every other year, someone is awarded Disney Legend status for having made an extraordinary contribution to the Walt Disney Company. Floyd Norman is one of the chosen few. In 1956, he became the studio's first African-American animator and worked on some of its most iconic creations, as he tells Outlook's Maryam Maruf. Sofie Hagen manages to find the funny side of her problems with depression and anxiety and has the knack of making other people laugh at them too. She's an award-winning Danish comedian, who tops the bill at home and abroad. Outlook's Tim Allen finds out how she got into the business through a teenage obsession with the Irish boy band Westlife.
