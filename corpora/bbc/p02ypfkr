Salt has, in some ways, been as geopolitically important as oil or water. In trade, in food and in human health it is a critical ingredient. Tim Marlow talks about different aspects of salt with four expert guests. Adel Sharif, Professor of Water Engineering and Process Innovation at Surrey University explains the latest developments in desalination; historian Professor Paul Lovejoy, discusses his book ‘Salt in the Desert Sun’ which looks at a history of salt production in parts of Africa, Graham MacGregor; Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine and Chairman of World Action on Salt & Health at the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine examines salt and health but also salt in a cultural context and Mikki Osterloo, a planetary and geological research scientist, who discovered approximately 200 places on southern Mars that show characteristics consistent with salt, explores salt- and therefore possibly water- on Mars.
