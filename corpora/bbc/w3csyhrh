Police officer Grant Edwards was once Australia’s strongest man. He is known for incredible feats of physical strength—like pulling trains, planes and trucks. Meanwhile, at work, he fought online child exploitation and human trafficking for years. It was a harrowing job, and eventually it took its toll on Grant. He told Outlook’s Jo Fidgen how he ended up grappling with PTSD, and that he's now committed to helping others with mental health issues. He's written a book about his experience called The Strong Man. Rose Dakuo came to the UK from Ivory Coast as a refugee when she was a teenager. She has since dedicated her life to sharing West African food with others in her community in north London. Eugen Vaida runs the Ambulance for Monuments in Romania—a team that travels around the countryside rescuing old, decrepit buildings. Outlook’s Stephen McGrath went to meet him.
