Back in the 19th Century, a Parsi family from Bombay called the Tatas began to trade internationally. From their humble beginnings has emerged India’s biggest business group, which is now a major force in the global economy. Dr Zareer Masani knows the story well, as the son of a former senior Tata executive. He tells the story of Tata’s expansion into steelmaking, hotels, aviation and ICT. He charts the international ambition of this enormous concern, which now owns well-known British brands like Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley tea – and which is now the biggest industrial employer in the UK. Throughout its history, Tata has taken pride in its social conscience, with generous support for philanthropic causes – although it has also provoked criticism on occasion for its industrial and environmental record. Now, the Tata family no longer controls the companies which bear its name - and which are competing in new and tougher markets. Can Tata hold onto its historic values in a world of the ruthless multinationals? (Photo: Jamshedpur steelworks. Credit: BBC) Show less
