Since high school, Juli Windsor's ambition has been to run the Boston Marathon. It is a hard enough feat for anyone to complete the 26 mile run, but Juli has dwarfism and is 3ft 9in tall - so, she has to take twice as many steps as everyone else. She was determined to complete in 2013 - and was very close to the finishing line when two bombs went off and the race was abandoned. Juli had to find the courage and the strength to run again the following year. Supporting her was journalist David Abel, who had been filming Juli's first attempt, and whose footage of the attack was played around the world. Bartholomaeus Grill, the German journalist who was seized by rhino poachers. As Yemen descends into civil war, Medecins Sans Frontiers doctor Valerie Pierre, describes working at a hospital in Aden.
