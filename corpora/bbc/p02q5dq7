19-year-old Kenyan student, Cynthia Cheroitich, has just survived a terrifying ordeal. She hid from gunmen for two days at Garissa University College, which was attacked nearly a month ago by militant Islamists from the group, Al-Shabab. They singled out 148 students, and killed them. Unsuk Chin grew up in a poor family in South Korea - with a passion for the piano. She's now one of the world's leading composers - her compositions are played by orchestras around the globe. Her first opera, Alice in Wonderland, has just been performed London. In May last year, British photographer Jack Hill and reporter Anthony Loyd were kidnapped while on assignment in Syria. Both were brutally beaten, and Anthony was shot in the leg. But they managed to raise the alarm and were eventually freed. Canadian-born Bruce Fogle isn't your ordinary vet. His books on keeping animals are read around the world. Now in his seventies, he still has a veterinary practice and he's just written a memoir, focusing on one summer in 1954, and a family holiday in Ontario, with an uncle who had a huge influence on his life.
