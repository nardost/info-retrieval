Back in the 1980s, there were very few professional black footballers in England. Paul Canoville was the first to play for Chelsea. He was over the moon when he was signed, but on his debut he was booed and racially abused by his own fans. He tells Jo Fidgen how he fought back and how his career paved the way for many other black players. In the eastern US state of Virginia, there is a series of caves known for their pools of water that look like mirrors, and their impressive stalactite formations. But there is also another strange and wonderful attraction there; an organ which makes music by striking the ancient stalactites. Outlook's Colm Flynn went to meet the man who plays it. Many couples like to tell the story of how they met. But few will top this one. Emmy Abrahamson and Vic Kocula met about a decade ago, they were far from home, and love was far from their minds. Outlook's Saskia Edwards has been speaking to the two of them. Louison Mbeya is a Congolese fashion designer who went from being homeless to becoming a stylist to the top Congolese musicians including Papa Wemba. (Photo: Paul Canoville playing for Chelsea.
