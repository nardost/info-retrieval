Kenyan Douglas Sidialo was blinded by an al-Qaeda bomb attack on the US Embassy in Nairobi in 1998. Since then he has overcome anger, forgiven the bombers and become a record breaking adventurer. He tells Jo Fidgen about what happened to him that day and his extraordinary personal journey. The controversial American director Quentin Tarantino talks to Samira Ahmed about his latest film, The Hateful Eight, which is set just after the American civil war at a period of great racial tension. And it was filmed during the recent racial tension in the States, after a number of black men were killed by police. So did Quentin Tarantino see the parallels? In Morocco, it is illegal to have sex outside marriage. And if a single woman becomes pregnant, she and her child will feel the full force of social disapproval. It is not a subject that is often discussed openly - but British film-maker Deborah Perkin managed to get incredible access to a court in Agadir where a woman was trying to get official recognition for her daughter, who is considered illegitimate. How would you feel about stepping into a coffin, hearing the lid nailed shut - and being left to your own devices? Thousands of South Koreans have chosen to do just that, many of them encouraged by their employers who think their workers are too stressed and need to get things in perspective. The so-called death experience programme was set up by funeral director, Jeong Yong Moon, who thought this extreme role play might encourage people to appreciate life more. (Photo: Douglas Sidialo.
