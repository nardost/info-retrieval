Bassem Youssef was a heart surgeon in Cairo during the Arab Spring when he started poking fun at the politicians in power. His style of subversive comedy was ground-breaking, and Bassem soon became one of the best known comedians in the Middle East. For a while he was described as 'Egypt's Jon Stewart'. Bassem's television show was wildly popular but his fan base didn't extend to the Egyptian authorities. His show was cancelled and soon he had to flee his home. He talks to Jo Fidgen about the personal price of satire in Egypt's revolution. Image: Bassem Youssef Credit: Kareem Mazhar Show less
