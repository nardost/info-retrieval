Anthony Julius tells Andrew Marr how far he thinks anti-Semitism pervades English culture*, while Alexander McCall Smith argues against the hegemony of the English language, in favour of Scots. Jonathan Safran Foer explores what we eat and why and whether meat is murder and Graciela Chichilnisky explores the links between danger, risk, climate change and changing behaviours. * In the course of this critical discussion about if and when anti-Zionist opinions may be characterised as anti-Semitic there was reference to Mr George Galloway. We are happy to make it clear that we did not intend to suggest that Mr George Galloway is in fact anti-Semitic. Show less
