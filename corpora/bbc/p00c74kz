Talat Hamdani Talat Hamdani's son Salman was one of an estimated 60 muslim victims of Al-Qaeda's attacks on the USA on September 11th 2001. The twenty three year old died as he went to help with rescue attempts at the World Trade Center. She tells Matthew Bannister how her grief was compounded when her son was initially treated as a suspect rather than a victim and why she supports the building of an Islamic cultural centre and mosque near Ground Zero. Desiree Snedorf We continue our series marking the 25th anniversary of the lifting of the ban of mixed race marriages in South Africa. Today we hear from Desiree Snedorf who got married to a white man from the Czech Republic in 1988. She describes how they were never able to date in public because they were a mixed race couple and how she would have to pretend to be his maid when she visited him. Will Lorimer Since September 2009, three British campaigners have travelled more than 28,000 miles, through 21 countries, aiming to raise awareness of the effects of rising sea levels. One of them, Will Lorimer, tells Matthew about their trip following the Atlantic coast at the one metre contour line. Show less
