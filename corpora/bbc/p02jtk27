More than 50 protesters and three policemen died in February last year during the bloodiest days of Kiev's Maidan uprising. A year on, we hear the stories of people in Maidan Square at the time - reporting, helping the wounded, and even getting married. Gabrielle Jackson is an Australian journalist who survived being run over by a train whilst on a trip to India. Antonia Eklund - the British girl who ended up dancing in a samba school at the world famous Rio de Janeiro Carnival parade. And the producer of Oscar nominated film Leviathan, Alexander Rodnyansky talks about the controversy surrounding the film and its depiction of Russia.
