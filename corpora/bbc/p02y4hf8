Rotherham is a deprived, industrial town in the north of England, which has been at the centre of a national sex abuse scandal. It's been revealed that as many as 1400 underage girls may have been groomed and abused by gangs over a period of 16 years. Sarah Wilson was abused from the age of eleven. Now 23, she has written a book about her experiences called Violated. Ahmed Dickinson Cardenas is a Cuban-born classical guitarist, now living in London. But his life could have worked out very differently. As a child he was more interested in pursuing a career in sport. He tells the BBC's Nicki Paxman why he ended up choosing music.

Dany Mitzman went to meet them as they were preparing for their trip. (Photo: Sarah Wilson) Show less
