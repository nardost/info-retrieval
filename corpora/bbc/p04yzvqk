Simon Peter Otoyo was abducted by the LRA as a child and forced to fight. He was blinded by gunshot and fearing for his life, he fled the LRA. He tells us about his dramatic escape through the bush and how he has turned his life around through knitting. Self-styled superhero 'Dante Caminante' from La Paz in Mexico dresses as a lucha libre wrestler to protect pedestrians and encourage motorists to drive safely. Reporter Clayton Conn spent a day as Dante's sidekick as he took to the streets. In January 2017 Chile suffered the worst forest fires in its history. More than 100 separate fires took the lives of 11 people, scorched 180,000 hectares, destroyed thousands of homes, and ruined livelihoods. We meet Yanette Letelier who is helping the isolated rural communities clear up after the devastation. (Photo: Simon Peter Otoyo and his knitting machine.
