Cecilio Lopez Tercero was exploring a deep cave in the remote north of Peru when he fell and injured his back. He was trapped for twelve days some 400 metres below ground. In then end more than a hundred people came from all over the world to help rescue him. Author and actor Ayub Khan Din grew up in England in a family of British/Pakistani descent. He tells Nicky Barranger how his childhood experience inspired him to write the play East is East, which became a movie in 1999. The play is now being revived in London's West End. 78 year old Cambodian rice farmer Uch Sorn is one of just a handful of survivors of the notorious Khmer Rouge prison camp known as M-13. Hundreds - perhaps thousands - died in the camp in the 1970s. Forty years after his release, Uch Sorn took our reporter Robert Carmichael back to the site of M-13. Dan McIntosh has been a travelling cook in the Australian outback since he was a teenager, cooking for the enormous cattle and sheep breeding stations there. In recent years he's been taking pictures of the people he works with and the land he lives on. When he started a Facebook page last year to share these photos, it went viral, and prompted other station folk from around Australia to contribute millions of their own photos. He's now published a book of the photos entitled Outback Stations. Show less
