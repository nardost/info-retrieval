Two animal psychologists and a historian of animal studies join Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough to discuss whether it's possible to recognise similar traits in humans, chimps, crows, hawks, dogs and cats in terms of affinity and attachment, despite different evolutionary paths,. Does your pet dog feel anger? Can a crow plan for the future? The Free Thinking Festival explores the emotional similarities & differences between humans & animals.
