When Damascus started going up in flames, Syrian viola player Raghad Haddad was able to get to Europe and to safety - thanks to her musical talent. But it meant leaving her small son behind while she fought for him to join her. Would he be willing to forgive her? She tells Jo Fidgen her story. Natalie Stearn is a sewer technician, also known as a flusher. She manages a team responsible for clearing the sewers of west and central London of 'fatbergs' - massive globs of congealed fat and waste. The work is physically demanding, smelly and it can be quite disgusting - but Natalie can't get enough of it. Outlook's Asya Fouks reports. At the age of 15, Brisa de Angulo was raped by one of her extended family members. When she finally found the courage to tell the police, she was ostracised and her case was sent to an agricultural and livestock court. After a traumatic experience in court, Brisa decided to set up A Breeze of Hope, a charity which provides medical, social and legal services to young rape survivors. Brisa is a nominee for Outlook Inspirations 2018, you can find the other nominees at this link: www.bbcworldservice.com/outlookinspirations. (Picture: Raghad Haddad. Credit: BBC.) Show less
