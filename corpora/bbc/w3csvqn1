Salim Shaheen is Afghanistan's most prolific film director. He has made over 100 films and appears as an actor in several of them. Salim has risked his life for his art, in a country where films were once banned by the Taliban and now he's the subject of a documentary film himself, The Prince of Nothingwood. He tells Matthew Bannister his story. Violinist Won Hyung Joon has a unique idea to bring peace between North and South Korea. He dreams of an orchestra made up of musicians from across the great divide that could perform at special events and eventually tour the world. Jason Strother reports from Seoul. Roy Aspinall and Billy White are two brothers from Wigan in the north-west of England. They were separated for 28 years and only re-united after a chance offer of a cigarette. Tim Connaghan is America's full time national Santa Claus. Santa Tim has appeared in hundreds of television commercials and magazine adverts, and he is the star of the Hollywood Christmas Parade. In his spare time, Tim runs the International University of Santa Claus where you can get a PhD in Clausology. Colm Flynn reports from New York City.
