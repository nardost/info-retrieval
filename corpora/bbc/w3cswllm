Former US aid worker Kirk Wallace Johnson was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after spending a year in Iraq back in 2005. When he returned to America, he found some peace of mind fly fishing and discovered the art of Victorian salmon fly tying - where anglers would use feathers to bait fish. This eventually lead Kirk into an obsessive quest to solve the mystery of a heist of rare bird feathers. Shirley Ordo√±ez is a robotics engineer from Ecuador who's taken her electronic skills to fixing broken toys. She found a source of motivation following the death of one of her children. Clayton Conn reports from Shirley's toy clinic. Outlook's Jane Chambers meets the young Bolivians who dress up in zebra costumes to promote traffic safety in La Paz.
