Nairobi recently held a special outdoor film festival to celebrate film makers living in slums. One of those presenting his work was Ugandan, George Stanley Nsamba, a 25-year-old who grew up in Naguru, a ghetto in Kampala. He now helps other street kids get the skills to make films themselves. George has been telling me how he came to live in Naguru. American Cyndi Lauper became instantly recognisable in the 1980s as the playful pop star with pink hair. She composed some hugely popular hits, like Time after Time, True Colours and Girls Just Wanna Have Fun. Cyndi recently became the first female soloist to win a Tony award for best score - for the Broadway hit musical, Kinky Boots. The show was inspired by a true story about a shoe factory owner from Northampton in the English Midlands, who inherits a failing business, and starts making shoes especially for drag queens, men who dress up in outlandish costumes and wigs. Just down the road from the Outlook studio in Broadcasting House, is Liberty of London, an iconic department store that's practically an institution in the city. Its managing director is New Yorker, Ed Burstell. He told Outlook how he built his career which started at the very bottom, on the shop floor spraying perfume. If you ever go for a walk in the woods, how much attention do you pay to the way it sounds? A bunch of architecture students from Estonia have installed three giant wooden megaphones in the forest outside the capital, Tallinn, to encourage people to climb in and listen to what's going on around them. 21-year-old Birgit Oigus came up with the idea - she's been telling me more about the project.
