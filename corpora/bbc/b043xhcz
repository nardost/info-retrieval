Rana Mitter talks to MP and historian Tristram Hunt about the urbanising effects of Britain's trading Empire as the pair walk the streets of London finding reminders of, and signposts to, the dominating imperatives and concepts of the era.

Rana Mitter is joined in discussion by Lord Bhikhu Parekh, Dr Shruti Kapila and the writer, Pankaj Mishra. Producer: Jacqueline Smith. Show less
