Romulo Emiliani is the Roman Catholic bishop of San Pedro Sula, a city in northern Honduras recently described as 'the most violent city on Earth'. Last year, the Bishop made the news after he helped broker a truce between two of the country's most notorious street gangs - the Mara Salvatrucha and the Mara 18. Jamie Andrew is a Scottish mountaineer who lost his hands and feet to frostbite after a tragic mountaineering trip, in which his friend and climbing partner died. Jamie describes how, with rehab, he gradually learned to adjust to a life with prosthetic limbs. German-American photographer Gerd Ludwig has spent the past two decades documenting the long-lasting impact of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster back in 1986. The result is a book and an exhibition called The Long Shadow of Chernobyl, which opens in Vienna next month. For Outlook, Laura Hubber goes to visit him at his studio in Los Angeles. In May 1913, a young German man named Richard Platz cast a beer bottle containing a postcard into the Baltic Sea. In March this year, a fisherman found the bottle in his net and handed it to the International Maritime Museum in Hamburg. Now researchers have tracked down Richard's nearest living descendent - his granddaughter Angela Erdmann, who lives in Berlin.
