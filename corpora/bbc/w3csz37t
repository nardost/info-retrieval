In April 1997 a woman dressed as a nurse walked into a Cape Town hospital and left with a new born baby. The baby's name was Zephany Nurse but she was raised by the woman who kidnapped her as Miche Solomon. It would be 17 years before she discovered her true identity and was forced to make some impossible decisions. Miche recently released a book based on her remarkable life story called: Zephany, Two Mothers One Daughter.
