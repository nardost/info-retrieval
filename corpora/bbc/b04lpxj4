Peter Carey's new novel Amnesia counterpoints modern hackers with murky incidents in Australia's recent past as a writer explores where countries and individuals stand in the modern world. And, as a new book calls on historians to take a more active role in debates over global inequality, climate change and governance, Rana Mitter is joined by The History Manifesto's co-author, David Armitage, Chris Skidmore MP and historian, and Lucy Delap, Director of History and Policy to discuss how and when history lost its place at the top table, the uses of micro-histories versus the long duree, and how new technology to handle big data might harness them both to help decision-takers and policy makers.
