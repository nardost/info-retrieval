Rana Mitter chairs a debate from the 2013 York Festival of Ideas on the legacy of the War of the Roses with historians Sandy Grant and Mark Ormrod and author Helen Castor reflecting on how the Wars of the Roses shaped the country from the 15th century right up to the present day. In the year that Richard III's remains were identified beneath a Leicester Car Park, why does the Wars of the Roses continue to exert such a hold over our imaginations, from Game of Thrones to the BBC series The White Queen?
