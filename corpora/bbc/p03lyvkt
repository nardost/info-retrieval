Justice Edwin Cameron is a senior judge in the highest court in South Africa - the Constitutional Court. As a young lawyer he was known for taking on the toughest cases. He is also a prominent LGBT rights and HIV/AIDS campaigner - issues which still carry stigma in South African society. The prejudice was even stronger back in 1999 when he publicly revealed he was HIV positive - becoming the first public official in the country to do so. In a remote valley in Iceland two brothers on neighbouring farms haven't spoken to each other for 40 years. But they're brought back together again on a mission to save the thing that is most precious to them - their sheep. This is the story of `Rams' - the film by Icelandic writer director Grimur Hakonarson which has won 24 awards since its release. When he was just 8 years old, Amir Hussain Lone lost both his arms in an horrific accident at his family's saw mill in Indian-administered Kashmir. He didn't let this stop him and hard as it was, he learned to live without his arms. Now, 18 years later, he's mastered cricket. (Picture: Justice Edwin Cameron. Credit Andrew Aitchison.) Show less
