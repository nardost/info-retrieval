CORRIDORS Rachel Hurdley, Research Associate at Cardiff University’s School of Social Sciences, talks about the findings of her latest research into what she calls ‘the power of corridors’. Rachel conducted her research in the ‘Glamorgan’ building in Cardiff, it is a very grand former local authority building now housing two university departments and has a lot of corridors along which many academics have their offices. She followed people during their working days to find out what takes place informally in corridors, and the part they play in the life of an institution. MARGARET MEAD & MARY DOUGLAS Laurie Taylor is joined by Professor Adam Kuper to discuss the varied lives and contrasting ideas of two renowned anthropologists of the twentieth century, Margaret Mead and Mary Douglas.
