Last Broadcast Date: Fri 5 Apr 2013
Matthew Bannister meets the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay. A bus driver's daughter from a poor Indian section of Durban in South Africa, Navi grew up and began her human rights work during the apartheid era and became the first non-white woman to establish her own law practice and to be appointed as a High Court Judge in South Africa. We also hear from a disabled British woman who has found a new sense of freedom by going diving in her wheelchair. She told Matthew Bannister how it feels like to explore the bottom of the sea in a specially designed wheelchair. Then, Mexican artist Pedro Reyes explains how he has managed to turn firearms into an orchestra of fully-workable musical instruments - from flutes to drum kits. His artwork aims to highlight Mexico's drug-related violence and crime. And, in our 'Witness' segment, Louise Hidalgo talks to a Californian journalist who knew Howard Hughes, an American billionaire who died in April 1976 after years of living in hiding.
