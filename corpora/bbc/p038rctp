Cameraman John Aitchison has devoted his life to making films about wildlife in some of the world's most inaccessible places. He's had some close encounters, including one with a Polar Bear which liked to track people while they were on the telephone! While John's job would be a dream to many, Joseph Bulure Robi's role recent turned into a nightmare. He was taking part in a dangerous mission to rescue eleven miners in Tanzania when the roof of the mine collapsed - and Joseph and several of his colleagues were stuck underground. Somayya Jabarti is the editor-in-chief of the Saudi Gazette, one of the biggest English-language dailies in Saudi Arabia. As the first female editor of a major publication in the country, she has risen to the top in a society with very few female leaders. But, as a child she dreamed of being a doctor. Ahmed Ustic is devoted to his career as a hairdresser. But he's faced many obstacles in pursuing it. Twenty years ago he survived one of the most violent incidents of the Bosnian War, when 8,000 Muslim men and boys were massacred by Serbian forces as they fled from the town of Srebrenica. But today Ahmed is one of the few Muslims who have returned to the town to reopen his family business. And, if you had ten minutes to pitch to Hollywood film director, Steven Spielberg, what do you wear? When British writer Matt Charman found himself on the phone to the movie heavyweight, he was just in his underwear. Fortunately Spielberg liked the story and Charman then wrote the screenplay to the director's last film 'Bridge of Spies'.
