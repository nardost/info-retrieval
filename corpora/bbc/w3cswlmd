Elizabeth Gomm lost her partner Mike, to cancer, after 25 years together. She decided to put a plaque and a sign on a local park bench in Blackpool in the UK, asking people who sit there to send her their own stories. Straight away she received some messages and soon became overwhelmed with the response. Jody Scaravella employs grandmothers from all over the world to work as chefs at his restaurant in Staten Island, Enoteca Maria.
