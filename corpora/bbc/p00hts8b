Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today we speak to war correspondent Janine di Giovanni who didn't realise she was traumatised by her harrowing reports from some of the world's most dangerous battlefields until the birth of her son. Janine describes finding everyday life harder to cope with than life on the front line. Also, Leslie Duff, the 400lb Canadian man desperate to lose weight, but too embarrassed to exercise in public. Leslie explains to our reporter Sian Griffiths how he overcame this obstacle by offering his cleaning services in exchange for the use of a private swimming pool. And Finnish student Laura Puukko tells us why she abandoned her holiday in India to train as an elephant handler. Show less
