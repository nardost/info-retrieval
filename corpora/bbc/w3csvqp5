Canadian adventurer Laval St. Germain has climbed six of the seven highest mountains in the world and cycled across the Arctic. But his biggest test came when his 21-year-old son Richard, also an adventurer, died in a canoeing accident in 2014. Last year, Laval decided to row across the Atlantic in memory of Richard. Simon Skhosana has become a local sensation in the small village of Moloto, in South Africa, because he uses scraps to make pedal cars. Mpho Lakaje reports. Amateur Swedish photographer Hans Nilsson spent three years looking for a rare white moose called Ferdinand. Hans made a video of Ferdinand swimming in a stream that went viral. But a few weeks ago Ferdinand charged a woman who was walking her dogs and the police decided he had to be culled. Hans started a campaign to save the moose and the cull was called off. In the northern province of Chiang Mai in Thailand, there is a prison where you can voluntarily go in to be massaged by inmates who are learning the trade as part of their rehab.
