Sungju Lee was born in the North Korean capital Pyongyang. As a child he idolised the country's communist leaders and dreamed of following his father into the People's Army. But those dreams crumbled very quickly. Sungju's comfortable life was uprooted and he had to confront starvation, homelessness and even death. Professor Robert McCauley leads a team of scientists in Australia that has discovered how some types of fish sing underwater. Yuri Norshtein, the Russian animator, has inspired generations across the world with his award winning films including Hedgehog in the Fog. Yuri doesn't rush his work, in fact he's been nicknamed The Golden Snail, because fans have been waiting 35 years for him to finish his film The Overcoat, based on a classical Russian short story. Our reporter Tatyana Movshevich met him at his studio in Moscow. Image: Sungju Lee Credit: BBC Show less
