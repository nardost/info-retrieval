Bishop Agapit is the head monk of a monastery in Kiev. In November the monks found themselves drawn into the crisis in Ukraine - the Bishop turned the centrally located monastery into a field hospital for injured protesters. He tells Jo Fidgen why the monks decided to open their doors. The Georgian mezzo soprano, Nino Surguladze, has sung on stage all over the world since she became an international star at the age of 23. But fame first found her at the age of nine when she was chosen to star alongside dolphins in a Georgian film. She speaks to the BBC's Nicki Paxman. And, from James Stewart to Marlene Dietrich - Jo Fidgen speaks to twin brothers Austin and Howard Mutti-Mewse who became pen-pals with some of the biggest stars in Hollywood during the 1980s while at school in England. They even went to some of their houses for tea and hung out with them in California. They have written a book about their adventures entitled I Used to Be in Pictures.
