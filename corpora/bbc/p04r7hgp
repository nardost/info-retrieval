Mike Haines' brother, David, was executed by so-called Islamic State in Syria in 2014. He tells Outlook how they'd anticipated his kidnap, even down to developing a code to communicate with and why paying a ransom was never an option. Zohar Sharon is a champion golfer from Israel, but he has one big challenge to contend with - he can't see the ball or the green because he's blind. He tells Outlook why that hasn't stopped him from winning international championships and beating an ex US president. Adrian Slade and Wendy Shaw tell Outlook why they stand in the middle of the road and stop cars. They do this in Washington State to save venomous snakes from being run over.
