Joseph Bulure Robi was taking part in a dangerous mission to rescue 11 miners in Tanzania who had got into difficulties in a gold mine in the north-west of the country. But then the roof of the mine collapsed - and Joseph and several of his colleagues were stuck underground. Their terrible ordeal only came to an end when they were rescued themselves after nearly six weeks. James Lynch is a financier who was brought up by his American parents in Brazil. In 1996 he and his teenage son were part of a team which went into the Brazilian rainforest to solve the mystery of a British explorer who had gone missing in the same area many years before. In 1925 Percy Fawcett had set off to discover what he believed to be a lost civilisation - but was never seen again. But then, James himself got caught in a difficult situation. In 2013, the retired American basketball star, Dennis Rodman decided to put together a team to take on the North Korean national side in Pyongyang. Dennis had become friendly with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But his trip to a repressive country where the United Nations describes human rights abuses as "without parallel" quickly became the subject of acute international criticism. A film producer from England called Colin Offland was intrigued by the trip and decided to make a documentary about it. (Photo: Joseph Bulure Robi. Credit: Sammy Awami) Show less
