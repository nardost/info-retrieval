Natasha Bakht and Lynda Collins are two friends from Canada who have formed an unprecedented family unit. They have been able to use their experience as professors of law to help become the first co-mothers of their kind to a little boy - even although they are not romantically involved. Roberto Polidori is a former engineer who decided it was time to radically change his life after a car accident almost killed him. He now runs the oldest barbershop in Rome, which he inherited from his uncle Silvano. In the Philippines, president Rodrigo Duterte has launched a crackdown on drug users and dealers, which has led to thousands of extra-judicial killings. Police say overall crime has decreased, but many people object to the hard-line approach. Among the many photo-journalists documenting the killings, is a Catholic brother called Jun Santiago. Reporter Aurora Almendral joined Brother Santiago on a night of photographing harrowing crime scenes. Image: Lynda Collins and Natasha Bakht Credit: Lynda Collins and Natasha Bakht Show less
