Harry Dyer is a 25-year-old pilot and conservationist who patrols Tsavo National Park in Kenya. In January 2017 Harry was on a routine patrol when he crashed his plane receiving burns to 49% of his body. Harry survived the ordeal and is now raising money to build a dedicated burns unit in Kenya. In Mexico you might see people praying to a figure of a skeleton. It's a saint who's part of Mexican folk tradition, and the embodiment of death. Outlook's Clayton Conn went to Mexico's capital, to meet a woman who devotes herself to 'Lady Holy Death' and looking after her shrine. Richard L. Spencer was in US soul group The Winstons who unknowingly created one of the most famous drum breaks in the world. The Amen Break is a 6-second drum solo first featured on an obscure 1960s track called Amen Brother but has now been sampled in songs by artists including Amy Winehouse, NWA and the Prodigy.
