Tom Saater is one of Nigeria's top photographers. He's the 'go to' for big international titles like the New York Times, Huffington Post and Bloomberg amongst many others. But he didn't learn his trade at a prestigious college, he learned it while living on the streets. Tom's covered stories from the insurgency in northern Nigeria to elections and climate change, but one of his most emotional projects has involved using his camera to find himself the family he never had. Outlook Inspirations nominee Mbarouk Mussa Omar is from Pemba in the Zanzibar archipelago, a tiny tropical island once known as the "green island." He trained as an accountant but had always loved nature. When he noticed that the forests in his home were shrinking, he decided to do something about it. In 2007, he began collecting seeds and persuaded his community to start planting trees. In one year they planted 100,000 trees. Now, 10 years on, Mbarouk has helped to plant over two million trees and is on a mission to save his island.
