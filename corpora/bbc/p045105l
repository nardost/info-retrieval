Two years ago, Japan was gripped by scandal when a musician called Mamoru Samuragochi was revealed to be an imposter. Samuragochi was a star in Japan - he claimed to have lost his hearing at the age of 35 but had continued to write music which was hugely popular. The scandal broke when it was revealed that a part-time music teacher called Takashi Niigaki was in fact the composer of much of the music that had been credited to Samuragochi.
