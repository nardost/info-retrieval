COOK BOOKS and IDENTITY New research shows that people’s choice of cook books is governed by the kinds of lifestyles or ideologies that they represent rather than by the recipes and skills imparted within; it also reveals that celebrity chefs may have less to do with a food renaissance in this country and more to do with the collapse of cooking traditions within families. Laurie Taylor discusses celebrity cook books and Britain’s food culture with social scientist and author of the research Andrea Tonner and food critic and cultural commentator Jonathan Meades. CULTURE AND GLOBALIZATION A new collection of essays entitled Cultural Politics in a Global Age raises questions about globalisation and cultural identity. Henrietta Moore, Professor of Social Anthropology at the London School of Economics and co-editor the book talks about the resilience of such identity in the face of external threats, about the relative success of campaigns against globalisation and about the manner in which the opportunities provided by global communication can provide alternative centres of power and influence.
