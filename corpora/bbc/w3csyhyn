Amber Scorah grew up in Canada in a family of Jehovah’s Witnesses. She was passionate about her belief and moved to Shanghai to become an undercover missionary – undercover because of the restrictions on religious preaching in China. She was determined to convert people, but ended up doubting her own faith. However Amber knew that if she left the religion, she would be ostracised from her community and family. She tells Emily Webb her story. Caleb Swanepoel is a South African actor who embodies the word resilience. When he was a drama student he lost his leg in a shark attack while he was out surfing with his brothers. Now, he’s back on the stage and also back in the water – hoping to take his swimming talents to the 2020 Paralympics in Tokyo. Outlook's Andile Masuku went to meet him.
