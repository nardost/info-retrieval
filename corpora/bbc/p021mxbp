Carey McWilliams is blind and, along with his stick, carries a gun as he walks the streets of Fargo, North Dakota. He tells Alan Kasujja how he earned his licence, why he feels he needs to have a gun with him and how he supports other blind gun users in the USA. The successful Indian cinema actor and director Nagesh Kukunoor is known for his bold and thought provoking style. His popular movies range from Iqbal to his current film Lakshmi, based on real life cases of child trafficking. He talked about his unconventional movie career to the BBC's Shabnam Mahmood. In 1985, the life of young American living in Amsterdam was changed for ever by a song he heard on the radio. It drew Louis Sarno to the forests of the Congo basin in the Central African Republic - home to the Bayaka tribe of pygmies. Louis has lived there ever since, recording the songs and sounds which first caught his imagination, and which are gradually disappearing. He came to the Outlook studio to tell Alan Kasujja his story. Picture: Carey McWilliams Show less
