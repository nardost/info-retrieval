FAHEM BOUKADOUS Tunisia's caretaker government has released political prisoners detained under President Ben Ali's regime. Among them was the journalist Fahem Boukadous. He was arrested after reporting on protests against unemployment in 2008 and sentenced to four years in prison. He tells Matthew Bannister what it was like to be confined to a cell measuring 3 metres by 3 metres and describes how it feels to be a free man. POACHER TURNED GAMEKEEPER Felipe Vibas Arias was born on the virtually unspoiled Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica which is a haven for the country's wildlife. In 1974, the government created the Corcovado National Park there, but in doing so they evicted 160 families who had settled there, including Felipe's. He turned to poaching to survive. Outlook's reporter Laura Hubber finds out how this notorious poacher eventually became one of Costa Rica's most sought-after nature guides.
