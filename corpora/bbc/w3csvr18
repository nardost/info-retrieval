Juan Carlos Ortiz has won two Golden Lion awards, the advertising equivalent of a Hollywood Oscar. His first led to death threats from the Farc, an anti-government guerrilla group in his home country of Colombia. He won his second Gold Lion as a result of a secret coded message he embedded in a pop song meant for hostages of the Farc. Dutchman Arthur Brand used to collect old coins; now he travels the world trying to track down lost or stolen works of art. He has managed to locate artwork worth millions of dollars including Adolf Hitler's favourite Bronze horse statues.
