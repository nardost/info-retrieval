Aarti Thakur and Prashant Pingle have both survived acid attacks. At the time of their attacks, they were complete strangers, but now they have fallen in love and are getting married. Daniel Harris is on a mission: he rescues antique looms and brings them back to life. He's also learnt to use traditional weaving techniques dating back to the 1870s. He gave us a tour of his textile mill in the suburbs of London. Angie Thomas grew up in a violent neighbourhood in Jackson, Mississippi, where gang violence was part of her everyday life. Her debut novel, The Hate U give, was born very much from that experience and from her horror at recent high-profile shootings in the United States. It has become a bestseller. DJ Arnaud Bernard, better known on stage as Onra, is a French-Vietnamese artist who tours the world performing his unique style of instrumental hip-hop mixed with antique Chinese vinyl. But he never intended to be a musician: it was all down to a chance encounter in Vietnam that completely changed the trajectory of his life. (Picture credit: Aarti Thakur/Prashant Pingle.) Show less
