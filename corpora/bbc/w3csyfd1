Shukrullah Zeerak was only 17 years old when he lost part of his right leg in a landmine explosion in Afghanistan. The main breadwinner for his whole family, including three brothers and eight sisters, Shukrullah tried to keep his injuries a secret at first. Then, inspired by the physiotherapists who helped him, Shukrullah made up his mind to train as a physio. He now works at the Red Cross Orthopaedic Centre in Kabul. He tells Jo Fidgen why he's passionate about helping other people. Tyler Perry is a hugely successful actor, screenwriter, director and comedian. He's also owner of an enormous movie studio in Atlanta, Georgia - the new Tyler Perry Studios has just opened there and is one of the biggest film studios in the United States. It has 12 sound stages - all of them named after black icons. Tyler has created some of the most loved characters in American entertainment - in particular with his alter-ego Madea, the self-proclaimed "mad, black woman". And his studios, even before the official opening, had been used to shoot scenes for 'Black Panther' and 'The Walking Dead'. Last year, Tyler spoke to Outlook's Joe Pascal about his life and his extraordinary success. He told Joe how, as a boy, he would use his imagination to escape the violence of his father.
