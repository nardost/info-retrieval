Maryse Wolinski is the wife of Georges Wolinski, one of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists murdered in Paris in January. Georges was 80 years old and one of France's most beloved cartoonists. The Nepalese royal family used to have a taste for expensive cars. The only trouble was getting them to their palace in Kathmandu. There weren't any roads so an ingenious solution was devised. The cars would be carried across mountains on the shoulders of porters. 92-year-old Dhan Gole is believed to be the last surviving car porter of Nepal. Helena Rizzo was named the best female chef in the world last year - but before that she was a model and architecture student. Our reporter Gibby Zobel went to meet her in one of Sao Paolo's best restaurants. Cuong Vu has done something highly unusual for a single man in Vietnam - he's adopted a child. Cuong had always wanted children, but relationships hadn't worked out. So four years ago, he headed down the adoption route, a decision that brought him into conflict with traditional notions of the family. This must be one of the strangest journeys ever undertaken: In 1964 Australian Reg Spiers was an athlete who found himself in London without any money and desperate to get home. But he didn't have any money, so he posted himself in a box from London to Australia with the help of his English friend John McSorley. We got both of them together to tell the story.
