Afghan TV presenter Parwiz Sapy was injured as he helped colleagues to escape from a gun attack at Shamshad TV station in Kabul. He returned and presented the news hours later. Jesse Siebler and Taylor Stevens decided to test their new relationship by taking up a six-month volunteer role as the lone caretakers of Australia's southernmost lighthouse. It's a temporary position organised by Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service and Friends of Maatsuyker Island. In summer 2000, American rock climber Jason Smith and three friends were taken hostage by militants while climbing in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan. He faced the ultimate dilemma - kill or be killed.
