Nick and Diane Marson's flight was diverted after the 9/11 attacks. In the wake of one of the darkest periods in modern history, they met each other and found love. Their story inspired the musical Come From Away When Lennard Davis received an email from a stranger who said Lennard was his closest living relative, he thought it must be a scam. Lennard is a Jewish professor from New York, and the stranger claimed to be from a line of Polynesian chieftains. It took four years and the unravelling of two family secrets to solve the puzzle. When Nokubonga Qampi was told that her daughter was being raped by three men, she took action. One attacker would end up dead, the others seriously injured. Nokubonga was faced with the prospect of prison, but then her story made her famous and she became a hero to many. They called her 'Lion Mama'.
