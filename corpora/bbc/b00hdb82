DRUGS AND SOCIETY Angus Bancroft, author of a new book Drugs, Intoxication And Society and Dick Hobbs, Professor in Sociology with special reference to Criminology, at London School of Economics discuss how the effects of drink and drugs are affected by the context in which they are consumed. LADDISH MASCULINITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION A new study finds that 'acting cool' and 'having a laugh' is sabotaging the chances of male working class students at university. Whilst female working class students adapt to their new environment, their male counterparts struggle to fit in and are apt to withdraw into laddish behaviour. Laurie Taylor is joined by Si√¢n Preece, Senior Lecturer at the University of Westminster who contributed to the study, and Deborah Cameron, Rupert Murdoch professor of Language and Communication at Oxford University, to discuss the implications of this latest research with regards to a future widening participation in further education.
