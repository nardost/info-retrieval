The Nigerian artist Laolu Senbanjo grew up in the city of Ilorin, in western Nigeria, a Yoruba household. He became a human rights lawyer, but painting was always his passion. Eventually he moved to New York to focus on his art and ended up collaborating with Beyoncé. He worked on the video for her track 'Sorry' which features on the album 'Lemonade'. Three years ago, Mpho Madi wrestled her way into sporting history when she became the first South African woman to win a medal in her sport, taking bronze at the Commonwealth Games. It was a crowning achievement, after a very difficult start in life. She spoke to Outlook's Mpho Lakaje. The 27 year old Chilean, German Garmendia has more followers on YouTube than Justin Bieber. He has won Icon of the Year at the MTV Millennial Awards and has fans camping outside his home, but he remains a very down-to-earth guy. His life was not easy, he was bullied as a teenager and had to get over his father's death when he was three. And in the American state of Colorado, there's a place where nightmares are born. Ed and Marsha Edmunds have a studio where monsters are made, lifelike robots for use in movies, on stage, and in haunted houses. Image: Laolu Senbanjo Credit: TED Show less
