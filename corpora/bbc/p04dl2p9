Sulome Anderson was born in 1985 three months after her father, journalist Terry Anderson, was taken hostage in Beirut. Sulome went on to become a journalist herself reporting from that city. But, last year she experienced a remarkable coincidence when a seemingly routine interview turned out to be the start of an unforeseen relationship with her father's kidnapper. When Bangladeshi blogger Asif Mohiuddin was sent to prison for his writing, he bumped into the very man who had tried to kill him just months before.
