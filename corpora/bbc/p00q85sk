Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Twenty years after the siege of Sarajevo, American reporter Barbara Demick recalls how she managed to survive as the city was being shelled and came under sniper fire. She spent two years charting the lives of the multi-ethnic residents of Logavina Street. Her book about them is called Besieged.

And we hear from PC Sorcar and his daughter Maneka, members of India's most famous magical dynasty, who reveal their friendly professional rivalry. Show less
