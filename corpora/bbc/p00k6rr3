Berlin is a city that prides itself on fostering all sorts of creativity. A grand cultural past and a celebration of new design. So what is it that nourishes culture in this city? Is it despite or because of the generous funding by the government? Is Berlin immune from economic crisis, or does it thrive on being an oasis of creativity with a troubled past? Fresh perspectives from a young New Zealand poet on a visiting residency in Berlin, Courtney Meredith, the Australian novelist Peter Goldsworthy, and from Berlin, the publisher and editor who was Germanyâ€™s first Federal Minister of Culture, Michael Naumann. Plus lively comments from young Berliners and cultural visitors. Illustration by Emily Kasriel. Show less
