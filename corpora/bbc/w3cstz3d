Christopher Scott was sent to prison for a murder he didn't commit. He was exonerated over a decade later when another inmate confessed to the killing. Christopher tells Outlook's Jo Fidgen how he found himself under arrest and what happened when he met the man who turned his life upside down. Dr Emily Doolittle is a composer and zoomusicologist. She studies the relationship between the music that humans make, and sounds from the natural world - like the songs of whales and the howls of seals - to see what we can learn about animal communication. Alejandro 'Mono' Gonzalez is one of Chile's most iconic street artists. He's been painting political murals on the streets of Santiago for the last 40 years, starting off as a form of resistance under the dictatorship of General Pinochet. Outlook's Jane Chambers reports. Sister Laura Cristiana is a nun whose convent in central Italy was destroyed last year during one of the many powerful earthquakes to hit the region. She managed to save a very valuable artefact that's been looked after by nuns for centuries, a statue of the baby Jesus which became something of a symbol of resilience for many people.
