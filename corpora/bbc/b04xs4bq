A new history of ideas presented by Melvyn Bragg but told in many voices. Melvyn is joined by four guests with different backgrounds to discuss a really big question. This week he's asking How did everything begin? Helping him answer it are Cosmologist Carole Mundell, Historian Justin Champion, theologian Giles Fraser and Creation myth Expert, Jessica Frazier. For the rest of the week Carole, Giles, Justin and Jessica will take us further into the history of ideas about origins with programmes of their own. Between them they will examine early modern comet theory, Thomas Aquinas, The big Bang and Hindu Creation myths. In this omnibus edition all five programmes from the week are presented together.
