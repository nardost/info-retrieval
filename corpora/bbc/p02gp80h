Letty Hidalgo's son went missing when he was only a teenager. He is one of nearly 27,000 Mexicans who have "disappeared" between 2006 and 2012. When the state stopped looking into his case, Letty took up the quest to find her missing son. Thor Heyerdahl Junior is the son of the legendary explorer Thor Heyerdahl. He was the Norwegian man famous for making an astonishing journey in a primitive raft across the Pacific Ocean in 1947. A new film about the expedition called Kon Tiki is out now. Visinel Balan from Romania was put into an orphanage in 1987 when he was just two months old. He later found out that he was the youngest of 13 children, all of whom had been separated from the parents for their own protection. Now aged 27 Vi≈üinel is running an organisation which supports young people in today's state run child care system. War journalist Aris Roussinos specialises in covering the stories of rebels in conflicts all over the world. He tells us how he has nightmares about the scenes he has witnessed. Shailee Basnet is the leader of an all-female Nepalese climbing team who've become the first women team to conquer the highest mountains on all the seven continents. (Photo left: Aris Roussinos.
