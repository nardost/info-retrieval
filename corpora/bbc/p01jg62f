Lucy Ash speaks to Howard Dully, who as a child was subjected to an 'ice-pick' lobotomy. He has written a memoir, 'My Lobotomy' and wants to make a film about his life. We meet the Bolivian theatre troupe who have staged an unusual adaptation of Hamlet. Mumbai teenager Ayesha Aziz is only 17 and already has her student pilot's licence. She now has her eyes set on becoming an astronaut. A young Sri Lankan man, Zaid Careem, is making an unusual stand against the sexual harassment of women in his country. His tactics include climbing aboard buses in the capital and apologising for the behaviour of his fellow men. Picture: Howard Dully Show less
