As this year's Jewish Book Week launches in London - Matthew Sweet is in conversation with the Israeli novelist David Grossman. David Grossman's latest book Falling Out of Time mixes poetry, drama and fiction to explore the emotion of grief and loss. His own son died in 2006. He is also the author of non fiction books including Death as a Way of Life: From Oslo to the Geneva Agreement. When he was in London for Jewish Book Week last year, Free Thinking invited him to join Matthew Sweet in the studio to discuss his fiction and the part he hopes it can play in the discourse about Israel today.
