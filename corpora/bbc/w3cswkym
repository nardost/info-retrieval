There have been many glowing tributes over the weekend to Kofi Annan, former secretary General of the United Nations, who's passed away at the age of 80, but no one has mentioned the trouble he got into at school for challenging authority, how he coped with being a single parent, or how he responded to being mistaken for the actor, Morgan Freeman! These are just some of the things he told Outlook's Matthew Bannister about back in 2012 - as well as how he handled the most difficult situations the world faced during his decade as its top diplomat - 1997-2006. Another chance to hear this remarkable interview with a remarkable man. We hear the true story of a disaster that happened in the Pacific Ocean. In 1983, Tami Oldham Ashcraft was sailing in the Pacific ocean with her fianc√© Richard when a hurricane smashed their boat to pieces and threw him overboard. She tells Jo Fidgen how she was able to survive, against the odds. Image: Former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan Credit: Adam Berry/Getty Images Show less
