Catholic priest Father Alehandro Solalinde has taken on the criminal gangs and corrupt authorities to help the tens of thousands of migrants who cross Mexico every year bound for the US. He set up a shelter for migrants in the southern state of Oaxaca providing food, medicine and a place to stay on their journey. American Joyce DiDonato is one of the world's leading Mezzo Sopranos, performing with the finest orchestras around the globe and releasing chart-topping recordings. But her next album will be compiled by her fans, and released later this year. Film-maker Claire Belhassine grew up in the UK with a British mother and a Tunisian father. Every year she visited her grandfather, Papa Hedi, in Tunisia. But in her twenties she found out that Papa Hedi was also the Godfather of Tunisian music - Matthew Bannister finds out more. Identical triplets Angel, Cesar and Marcos Ramirez share the same wiry build, olive complexion, mussed hairstyles and coffee-coloured eyes. They are also all enrolled at Cuba's prestigious National ballet. Hear about the dancing triplets. (Image: Father Alejandro Solalinde with three migrants. Photo by Victor Manuel Espinosa.
