Amidst the slums of Kampala, MLISADA (Music, life skills and arts for destitution alleviation) is a success story. It is a children's home set up and run by former street kids who learned to play brass instruments. Twelve years on, it cares for 90 children, teaches them music and acrobatics and they are safe from the perils of street life. Former pupils like euphonium player, Franke, have gone on to be teachers within the wider school communities of Kampala. It is supported by keen brass players from around the world â€“ including BA pilot and trumpet player, Jim Trott who took star trumpet players Alison Balsom and Guy Barker out there last January to run music workshops with the pupils. Sarah talks to Alison about how her involvement with the work of Brass for Africa has influenced her approach to performing on concert platforms around the world. Most importantly, if you get to live in the Dream House, as it is known by the kids, you have got a chance of a future. A future where you can learn to be a teacher, or simply access a better school and then go on to get a better job because you have got the bedrock of living at MLISADA. Show less
