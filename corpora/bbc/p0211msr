Sanal Edamaruku is president of the Indian Rationalist Association. He has spent years travelling India debunking superstition and what he sees as 'false miracles'. Sanal outraged India's Catholic community when he denied on TV that water dripping from the foot of a statue of Christ in Mumbai was a miracle. He now lives in self-imposed exile in Finland - fearing for his safety. Lory Del Santo is an Italian TV presenter and model who had an affair with rock legend Eric Clapton in the 1980s. The couple had a son, Conor, who died aged four in a tragic accident, falling from the window of a New York apartment. Now Lory is working on a film about her life and talks to Matthew about coping with her son's death. Lebanon is host to the largest number of neighbouring Syria's refugees.
