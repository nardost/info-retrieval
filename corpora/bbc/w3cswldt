Link: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cswldt
Last Broadcast Date: Wed 12 Dec 2018
In January this year, a Greek pilot called Vasileios Vasileiou checked into the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul. The hotel was popular with international visitors - and the Taliban knew that. On January 20th they launched an attack and the hotel was under siege for more than fourteen hours. Vasileios was in his room and he hid in a bed frame to survive, while Taliban fighters operated from his room. For more than a decade, British DJ Deke Duncan ran a pretend music radio station from his garden shed, with his friends. They had only one listener - Deke's wife. But he is now broadcasting to thousands of people for the first time. Image: Vasileios Vasileiou and the bed frame that saved his life Credit: Vasileios Vasileiou Show less
