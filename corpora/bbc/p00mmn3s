This has been the decade of the NGOs (Non-Governmental Organisations). Their numbers, influence and range of activities have grown enormously. Many are now multi-million pound organisations. While many NGOs conduct themselves well, there are increasing worries about the accountability of NGOs and the extent to which the work they do is appropriate in the host countries. Allan Little looks at the work of NGOs in Malawi, India and Haiti, to consider some key concerns. In India we look at transparency and corruption and at who really benefits from the work of NGOs. Many people think that NGOs and the way they are set up, funded and made accountable for their work are now overdue for reform. We consider what a better future might mean for NGOs.
