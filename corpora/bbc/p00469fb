THE FORUM, the ideas programme presented by RITULA SHAH. This week we take a trip into real and imagined dystopian worlds… We travel to the future to meet the environmentally friendly humanoids from Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood’s latest book, “The year of the Flood”. She asks whether an environmental religion can prevent the extinction of the human race as we know it, or whether it would accelerate our evolution into a new, unrecognisable species. The British opposition security minister Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones argues that the right balance needs to be struck between privacy and the efficiency of the state. And sociology Professor Diego Gambetta peers down into the underworld to crack the codes and signals of criminal communication. We discuss how we modify our bodies and our communication in order to protect our planet and evade the state, both today and in a possible dystopian future. Show less
