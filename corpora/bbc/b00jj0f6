Laurie Taylor is in Leeds to visit the first exhibition to draw together images of how, historically, artists have represented the social order. He is joined by Alistair Robinson, the curator of Rank: Picturing the Social Order 1615-2009, as well as by political cartoonist Martin Rowson and sociologist Gordon Fyfe. They discuss evocative images, from The Chain of Being to the Map of World Poverty, and consider the challenges of demonstrating power, class and wealth in a visual way. Show less
