Champ of the Camp is a film which follows migrant labourers in Dubai who have entered a mostly Bollywood-themed talent contest. Lebanese film-maker Mahmoud Kaabour explains why he wanted to document these lives. Workaholic doctor Matthew Varghese works round the clock in India's last dedicated polio ward. Reporter Natacha Butler accompanies him on his rounds to hear from the patients who inspire him to keep going. Grammy-nominated American Jazz singer and songwriter Gregory Porter on music in church, imagining his father was Nat King Cole, and the career in American Football he chose not to pursue. And, the Lithuanian medical student with Asperger's Syndrome, who has overcome many obstacles to be on the verge of qualifying as a doctor specialising in genetics.
