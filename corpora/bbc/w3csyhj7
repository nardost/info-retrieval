Andreas Christopheros tells Emily Webb how he experienced life-changing injuries after surviving an acid attack on his doorstep. He had never seen his attacker before and had no idea why he had been targeted. A police investigation revealed that this was an act of vengeance, but his assailant had got the wrong person. Bonga Kuenda is one of Angolaâ€™s most notable musicians, a master of the semba - a genre of traditional Angolan music. He was born during Portuguese colonial rule, and before music, Bonga had forged a career in athletics. In the 1960s, he was the fastest sprinter in the Portuguese Empire, but he was racing for a regime that he was secretly trying to bring down.
