Photographer Vicky Roy spent his childhood on the streets of Delhi. A charity took him in and introduced him to photography. Vicky started taking photos with a plastic camera, and eventually began charging his friends for portraits. He went on to become a successful photographer with a reputation for evocative photos of street children. He told Outlook’s Jo Fidgen his story. Frank Shankwitz is the co-founder of the Make-A-Wish Foundation, an organisation that since 1980 has granted hundreds of thousands of wishes for children with life-threatening medical conditions. Frank’s inspiration came from his own difficult childhood, a near-death experience and an encounter with a 7-year-old boy named Chris Greicius. Frank is the subject of a recently released feature film called Wish Man. He spoke to Outlook’s Andrea Kennedy. Picture: Vicky Roy Credit: Courtesy of Vicky Roy Show less
