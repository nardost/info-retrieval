The famous primatologist Jane Goodall went to live with chimpanzees in Tanzania and made a discovery that inspired a new way of thinking about apes and about ourselves. For a while the American primatologist Dawn Prince-Hughes was a dancer in a peep show and spent her earnings on going to the zoo. In her thirties Dawn was diagnosed with a form of autism and through observing gorillas, she learned the social rules of human behaviour.
