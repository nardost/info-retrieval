Ana Victoria Bastidas grew up in northern Colombia. In the 1990s she was working as a health worker when she was kidnapped by a guerrilla group and was held for five days. Although she was badly beaten, she spent 25 years being silent about her ordeal, but is now part of "The truth, memory and reconciliation commission of Colombian women in the diaspora", where she has started sharing her story to help other women. She is now about to become the first Colombian female Anglican priest. Ravibandu Vidyapathi is a prominent Sri Lankan drummer, dancer, choreographer and creator of a new form of stage spectacle designed to revive traditional dances. 28 year-old Gavin Reid has just been awarded one of the top honours in the yachting world for his bravery. Gavin is deaf and had no previous sailing experience when he decided to take part in a sailing race around the world. On this race Gavin came to the rescue of five people, one of whom had been trapped on the mast for 9 hours. (Picture: Ana Victoria Bastidas. Credit: Conciliation Resources/Ingrid Guyon.) Show less
