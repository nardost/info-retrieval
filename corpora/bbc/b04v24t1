Last Broadcast Date: Thu 18 Dec 2014
In an extended interview, Philip Dodd talks to Clive James whose writing and broadcasting in the last fifty years has made him one of the most distinctive voices in Britain. You might remember him for his funny, irreverent and sharp television reviewing; or perhaps you recall Unreliable Memoirs, his dazzling account of growing up in Sydney in the Forties and Fifties; perhaps his venture into popular music with Pete Atkin is still firmly lodged in your mind or his career in Footlights. He has always been prolific and there's no sign that he's slowing down even though he's been dogged by serious illness in the last few years. He confirmed his credentials as a translator last year with his version of Dante's Divine Comedy and his latest book, Poetry Notebook, is a testament to his consuming love of poetry in general. Philip Dodd explores this passion with him and learns how it has informed and illuminated his thinking throughout his life.
