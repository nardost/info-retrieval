As a 14-year-old, Matthew Boger was living on the streets of Los Angeles having been turfed out of the family home for being gay. One evening Matthew was attacked by an older boy named Tim Zaal who was a member of a violent gang of Neo-Nazi punk rockers. A chance meeting 26 years later lead to the pair forming an unexpected friendship. Mexican artist Abraham Cruzvillegas uses discarded materials and everyday objects to create his work. His latest piece at London's Tate Modern art gallery is called Empty Lot. It contains 240 raised planters filled with soil from all over the capital and is inspired by his own family's story of fighting for land rights in Mexico City. Rajkumari and Panilal Yadav are from a village in the western plains of Nepal where they were married when they were just seven and eight years old. Now they campaign against other Nepalis having to get married while still children. Back in 1992, Mae Jemison became the first African-American woman in space. Today, she leads the 100 Year Starship Project - funded by the American government - which is trying to make it possible for humans to travel outside the solar system within the next century.
