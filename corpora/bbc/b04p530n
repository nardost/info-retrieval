How much self-knowledge do you need to be happy - and what are the limits to what you can achieve alone? Paul Dolan, Vincent Deary and Beatrix Campbell ask why everybody from governments to therapists want us to be happy. Chaired by Rana Mitter. Paul Dolan is Professor of Behavioural Science at the London School of Economics, a government advisor on well being and author of Happiness by Design. Dr Vincent Deary is a senior lecturer in health psychology at Northumbria University. The first book in his trilogy about how to live is called How We Are. Beatrix Campbell received the OBE for 'services to equal opportunities'. Her most recent book is End of Equality. Recorded in front of an audience at BBC Radio 3's Free Thinking Festival of Ideas at Sage Gateshead in 2014.
