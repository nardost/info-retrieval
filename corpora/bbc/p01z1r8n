Loretta Rosales is one of the Philippines' leading human rights campaigners. She herself was imprisoned and tortured during the dictatorship of President Marcos. Years later, she was elected to Congress, where she discovered that one of her fellow politicians was the military man who had abused her. James Matthews has gone from being homeless to playing in New York's prestigious Carnegie Hall concert venue. He won a place at music college but he couldn't afford his living expenses - so for 18 months he slept rough. James has just won a prestigious piano competition. Felicity Finch reports on the rich cultural tradition of drumming in Rwanda and how it is being used to heal the wounds from the violence and trauma of 20 years ago, when an estimated 800,000 Rwandans were killed in the space of 100 days. Daniel Antoine spends his working life examining human remains that are thousands of years old. He is curator of Physical Anthropology at the British Museum in London. Without unwrapping the mummies, Daniel and his team have used CT scans to reveal what is hidden by their grave clothes. (Photo: Loretta Rosales with Outlook presenter Matthew Bannister) Show less
