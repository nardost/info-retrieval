Anza, Sibusiso and Freddy are unemployed. Like many 20-somethings in Soweto they are all looking for work. Unemployment in the Johannesburg suburb is well above South Africa's national average. "I don't have something that is challenging me... I need challenge in my life." Hardly surprising then that many young people have become "discouraged jobseekers".
