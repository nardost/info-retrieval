As the man in charge of the Oregon State Penitentiary, Frank Thompson presided over the only two executions carried out there over 50 years. That was in the late 1990s. Frank continued working in the law enforcement system until his retirement in 2010. Since then he has spoken out against the death penalty, and particularly the negative impact it has on those who have to carry it out. Innocent Magambi was a refugee for twenty seven years. He was born in a refugee camp and went on to live in five different African countries. Today he's based in Malawi and devotes his life to helping other people who have been through similar displacement. He's written a book about his experiences called Refugee for Life. The small mining town of Coober Pedy in South Australia is known as the Opal Capital of the World. More than three thousand people live there, but you might struggle to tell. That's because a lot of life in Coober Pedy is spent underground. There are even underground houses, motels, bars and museums. Outlook reporter Michael Dulaney drove out to this remote subterranean community to find out more. (Picture: Frank Thompson. Photo credit: Caren Ann Jackson.) Show less
