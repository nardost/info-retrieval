This is a story of loot, revenge and devastated beauty that still looms over British-Chinese relations. The imperial summer palace in Beijing was an extraordinary collection of beautiful architecture, landscapes and precious art. It was looted by invading French and British troops in 1860. Then the British commander, Lord Elgin, ordered its complete destruction. It was a dramatic moment of 'national humiliation' every Chinese schoolchild learns about today, encouraged by the communist government. Chris Bowlby discovers why it happened, with a surprising personal twist along the way. He discovers that it was the torture and murder of his ancestor, the journalist Thomas Bowlby, that led Lord Elgin to destroy the palace. There is a rare interview with the current Lord Elgin on his family's controversial role in imperial history. And what about all the looted art? We hear how it still sits in British museums, or re-emerges in lucrative auctions - while angry Chinese voices, including the martial arts star Jackie Chan, demand its return. And there’s the curious tale of a royal dog, too, ‘Looty’ - the first Pekinese to reach Britain after being taken from the Beijing palace.
