The so-called Islamic State has brought terror to the streets of Paris and Brussels, killing hundreds of civilians and wounding many more. But how does the organisation operate in Europe? And who has masterminded the deadly attacks? Award winning journalist Peter Taylor has been given access to secret intelligence documents that reveal how IS has carried out its attacks in Europe. Peter shows how IS operatives are supported by a sophisticated logistics network that supplies them with weapons and ammunition. And he also details how multiple intelligence failures led to the murder of 130 people in Paris. The mastermind of the attacks in the French capital was a man called Abdelhamid Abaaoud. During the course of the programme Peter Taylor unveils how this man recruited and trained radicalised young men to carry out attacks. And he also details how the western intelligence services were engaged in a desperate race to stop Abaaoud from bringing terror to streets of Europe.
