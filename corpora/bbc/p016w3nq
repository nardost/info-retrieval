Last Broadcast Date: Tue 16 Apr 2013
Matthew Bannister talks to Somali doctor Hawa Abdi about how her one-room clinic near Mogadishu turned into a 300-bed hospital, surrounded by a makeshift community of thousands of Somalis forced to flee their homes over two decades of violence. She tells her story in a new book, "Keeping Hope Alive", co-written with Sarah Robbins. Also, 18-year-old Kenyan student Sophie Umazi, who was determined to work towards preventing a repeat of the post-election violence of 2007. The result is her "I am Kenyan" photographic campaign, which has become an internet phenomenon. We also hear from Edward Petherbridge, the British actor who suffered a stroke while preparing to play King Lear - and has now turned the experience into a play - and listen to the story behind Rebel Riot, the punk rock band from Burma.
