Every year, thousands of young people from sub-Saharan Africa set off across the desert dreaming of a better life in Europe. Many fall prey to ruthless smugglers or find themselves stranded in a foreign country without the means to continue or return home. In 2007, Jenny Cuffe followed the journeys of migrants and now two years on, she traces the steps of Innocent Akibor, who set off across the Sahara for Spain - and investigates the fate of Fereinatu, who was working as a prostitute in Libya. In part one, she discovers that Innocent Akibor is in a Red Cross camp in Italy and after doing a deal with the authorities who want information about traffickers, was allowed to stay. She finds out the real reasons behind him leaving Nigeria and why the life destined for Innocent by the death of his father was not what he wanted. His mother had to beg him to leave the coutry as going against tradition put his life in danger. However, as Jenny reveals in this documentary, confronting the reality of life as a migrant in Europe, Innocent wonders if it was worth risking his life in the desert and at sea. As exploitation greets him at almost every step of his journey, listen to find out if his dream of reaching Spain for a better life has come true. Show less
