Matthew Bannister on The film director and actor Lord Attenborough. After a week of tributes, we bring you a highly personal interview in which he talks movingly about his family - and we cast light on his role in the development of London's Capital Radio. Also: human rights campaigner Helen Bamber who was inspired to devote her life to helping victims of torture by her experiences of working at the Belsen concentration camp after the war. The yoga guru BKS Iyengar who inspired millions of devotees around the world. And the neurosurgeon Sam Galbraith, who survived a lung transplant and became a Labour MP and MSP. Show less
