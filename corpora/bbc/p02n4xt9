Rene Denfeld is a death penalty investigator in Oregon in the United States. She talks to the prisoners, their families, their victims - to find out why they did what they did, and whether there are mitigating circumstances that could justify commuting the death sentence to a prison term. She has used these experiences as the basis of her first novel The Enchanted. English shepherd James Rebanks takes Jo Fidgen around his Cumbrian hill farm and talks about his life-long attachment to the landscape where he keeps 500 sheep. When Indian IT engineer Kiran Kanojia lost her left leg in a train accident three and a half years ago, doctors told her they could help her walk again but she would never be able to run. Kiran now uses of a curved prosthetic leg like the blades used by Paralympian runners and competes in half-marathons. (Photo: Rene Denfeld. Credit: Gary Norman) Show less
