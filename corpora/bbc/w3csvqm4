Mashal Khan had been wrongly accused of blasphemy, his father is now fighting for justice. Mashal Khan was a star student at university in northern Pakistan, and was known for his liberal views and for being outspoken. But then, rumours that he'd made blasphemous statements began to emerge, a serious and potentially dangerous allegation. The rumours soon led to violence, and Mashal was attacked and killed by a mob at his student residence. Now his father Muhammad Iqbal is campaigning for justice, and is campaigning against religious extremism. In Uganda, it's not that common to keep dogs as pets, instead they tend to guard things and are therefore are feared and distrusted. Francis Okello is trying to get his compatriots to see them in a more positive light. He recently set up the country's first ever therapy dog programme - to help people manage post-traumatic stress disorder. The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is a breakaway sect of the Mormon church in the USA. It's led by a man called Warren Jeffs, considered by his followers to be a prophet. Everything he says goes. Even when those things are illegal, immoral or both. Warren's daughter Rachel was one of those under his control, but she managed to get away.
