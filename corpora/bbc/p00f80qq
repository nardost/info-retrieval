DR DINA OMAR Last time Outlook spoke to Dina Omar she was dodging molotov cocktails in Cairo's Tahrir Square during the uprising there. Now the Egyptian-born doctor has travelled to Libya to help people caught up in the fighting there, even at the price of losing her job. She tells Matthew Bannister about her work and the effect it's having on her. WORLD 'S WEDDING PHOTOS As Outlook's contribution to the BBC's Royal wedding coverage we're making a montage of the World's Wedding Photos. Matthew hears some unusual wedding stories from Outlook listeners. Please send us one of your photos - the more informal or unusual the better. Just email them to outlook@bbc.com, or post them on the Outlook Facebook page. CARADOC KING Caradoc King is one of London's top literary agents.
