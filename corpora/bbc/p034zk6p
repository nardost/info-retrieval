The extraordinary journey of a father who wanted to live as a woman - and of the young daughter who had to come to terms with it. It was a difficult transition for the whole Shattuck family, and older daughter Sharon, who is now a film-maker living in New York, has turned the experience into a documentary. Blick Bassy is a musician who uses his music to keep alive the traditions and language of his native Cameroon. He has lived in France for 10 years, but continues to sing in Bassa - one of more than 260 languages spoken in Cameroon. He has just released his third album as a solo artist, called Ako - and has been speaking to Ella-mai Robey about his career - and his parents' reaction when he decided that he was going to build his life around music. Fatma Moustafa, her husband and their three very young children were fleeing Syria, hoping to reach Europe. They and nearly 50 others took a small dinghy which started to sink in the Mediterranean. In desperation, she called her brother, Khaled, who lives in the Swedish capital, Stockholm. The only clue to her whereabouts was the signal from her mobile phone - which the rescue services managed to track. Now living in Germany, she and Khaled explain how the drama unfolded.
