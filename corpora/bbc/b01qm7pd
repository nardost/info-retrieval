Weapon dogs - Laurie Taylor discusses the phenomenon of status dogs with Simon Harding, the author of 'Unleashed..' Also, the growth of 'Ned' pride in Scotland. 'Ned', or non educated delinquent, is the Scottish equivalent of the English term 'Chav'. It refers stereotypically to uneducated and anti social youth. But the sociologist, Robert Young, finds that some young Scots, including middle class teenagers, are proudly adopting the 'Ned' label as a mark of sub cultural rebellion. Stephanie Lawler, who has also studied the 'chav' phenomenon, joins the discussion. Producer: Jayne Egerton. Show less
