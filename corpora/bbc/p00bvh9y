ARON RALSTON What lengths would you go to to avoid your own death? The answer to that question from the young American climber Aron Ralston was almost unimaginable. He cut his own arm off with a penknife when he was trapped by a boulder in a narrow canyon in Utah. If Aron hadn't performed the excruciating amputation he would have died. The story - which happened seven years ago - hit the headlines around the world. Now it has been made into a Hollywood movie directed by Danny Boyle who won an Oscar for his previous film "Slumdog Millionaire". The new movie is called "127 Hours" - reflecting the length of time that Aron spent alone in the canyon before making his miraculous escape. He tells Outlook about his extraordinary feat of survival and how he found the physical and mental resolve to amputate his own arm. Show less
