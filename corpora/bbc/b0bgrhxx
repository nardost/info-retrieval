Greg Jenner on the great song and dance man Gene Kelly, star of Singin' In The Rain. "He was so much better than he had any right to be." Born in Pittsburgh in 1912, Gene Kelly was a broad-shouldered Irish American whose first love was ice hockey. But according to his biographer, Ruth Leon, he revolutionised movie-making by making the camera dance. Matthew Parris is impressed. Kelly's great films also include On The Town and An American in Paris - with extracts and archive, this is a joyful celebration of the great age of Hollywood musicals. Nominator Greg Jenner is historical consultant on Horrible Histories and author of Dead Famous: A History of Celebrity. The producer in Bristol is Miles Warde. Show less
