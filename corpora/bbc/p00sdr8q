Sharon Mascall meets Australians from all walks of life who have met Queen Elizabeth II during her many visits to the country. For Avril Oughton, it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience to meet the Queen but others like Margaret Cunningham - who first met the Queen in 1954 and then again in 2011 - have met her on several occasions. Sharon travels to Broken Hill in the outback and to Canberra to find out the imact the Queen's visits have had on the places and people she has met. The Queen's former Private Secretary Sir William Heseltine also sheds light on how the Queen's visits to Australia have changed over time. (Image: The Queen on walkabout in Sydney.
