Why are more and more people giving up all food produced from animals? Mary-Ann Ochota explores if itâ€™s natural for us to eat meat, and the impact on our health and the environment. She looks at how social media is helping spread the vegan message, the pros and cons of a solely plant based diet and whether eating meat today is ethical.
