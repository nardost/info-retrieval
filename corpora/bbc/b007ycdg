ON BRICK LANE Brick Lane Street in East London has historically been a unique world of cultural diversity and a gateway to waves of immigration from as far back as the Huguenots. Rachel Lichtenstein is the author of a new book entitled On Brick Lane, in which she traces the history of the street and argues that although often branded as emblematic of multi-cultural London, it has become Britainâ€™s most mythologized and misunderstood street. SEX AND THE WHIP What role has flagellation played in the history of sexuality and what is its place in contemporary culture? How does the whip link medieval religious devotion with modern pornographic imagery? Laurie Taylor discusses the place of the whip in the history of arousal with Niklaus Largier, author of In Praise of the Whip; A Cultural History of Arousal and with Kate Copstick, contributing editor of the Erotic Review.
