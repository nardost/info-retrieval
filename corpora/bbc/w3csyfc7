Around 25 years ago a group of middle-aged friends in the small English village of Port Isaac got together and started singing sea shanties, which are a type of maritime song. After a chance encounter with a BBC radio DJ Johnnie Walker, they ended up landing a £1 million record contract. Much to the group’s surprise, their album ended up in the charts. Since then, The Fisherman’s Friends have played at the Royal Albert Hall, the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and Glastonbury Festival. Things were going exceptionally well until 2013 when there was an accident backstage at one of their gigs. A metal door collapsed and killed singer Trevor Grills and the band’s tour manager Paul McMullen. The band didn’t perform for a year and in fact had no intention of singing again. However, they returned to the stage and this year have had a feature film made about them. It’s called Fisherman's Friends.
