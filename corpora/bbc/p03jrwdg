Report from Portsmouth on the salvage of King Henry VIII's ship, the Mary Rose, which sank in 1545. The ship had been buried in the soft muddy seabed and was discovered after a storm in 1970 unsettled it. Looking after the ship following her salvage has involved a decade-long process and the use of some of the latest scientific technology. Presented by Nick Rankin. Show less
