Blind American kayakers Erik Weihenmayer and Lonnie Bedwell have overcome the rapids of the Colorado River and paddled the entire length of the Grand Canyon. Retired lawyer John Cummings has built the USA's first museum of slavery The Whitney Plantation in Louisiana. He's created a powerful sometimes shocking commemoration of the lives and deaths of slaves. Dr Firas al-Kubaisy is one of the few paediatric cardiologists working in the Anbar region of Iraq. His life-saving work was disrupted when he was forced to leave during the fighting that broke out between government troops and ISIS early in 2014. He tells us about the terrible toll the conflict has taken on his young patients. As a child, Krithi Karanth went into India's forests with her family to watch tigers and leopards. Now she leads a team of conservationists at Bangalore's Centre for Wildlife Studies, who are working to understand more about conflicts between humans and the natural world. Lee Ridley is a comedian with a difference. He has cerebral palsy and as a result isn't able to speak. He tells his jokes through a communication aid. This summer the world's largest maze will open just outside Parma in Italy. It's called the Labirinto Della Masone and has been designed by Franco Maria Ricci.
