The award winning US photojournalist Lynsey Addario has been kidnapped twice, first in Iraq in 2004 and then again in Libya in 2011. Indhuja Pillai parents' attempt to find her a husband spectacularly backfired. Their bland and inaccurate online profile prompted her to write her own truthful one that said she was definitely not marriage material. Namibia Flores Rodriguez is the only female boxer in Cuba, a country that has won more Olympic boxing golds than any other and tops the amateur championship table. Maori actor Cliff Curtis is best known for his roles in the New Zealand films Once Were Warriors and Whale Rider. In his new film The Dark Horse he plays real life New Zealand hero Genesis Potini who is a bi-polar speed chess champion. Tommy Krangh is the sign language interpreter who gave such an energetic performance at this year's Eurovision Song Contest heat in Sweden that he completely upstaged the singer. A video of him dancing to Magnus Karlsson's song With Me In The Old Town has gone viral.
