When Howard Shulman was three days old he got an infection that destroyed part of his face. His parents left him in the hospital and he grew up with several foster families. It was nearly 40 years later when he made contact with his birth mother. He has just written a book about his extraordinary experience. (Photo: Howard Schulman. Credit: Eric Williams) Show less
