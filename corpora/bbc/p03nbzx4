Anatoliy and Svetlana Kosse have been married for almost 50 years and built a life together in the Ukrainian village of Peski. But two years ago fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian troops broke out and most people fled as the shelling started. Not Anatoliy though. He was not about to leave his home. Paddy Slattery grew up in an Irish country village to the west of Dublin. He left school early and at the age of 17 was working as an apprentice painter and decorator when one decision, whether or not to put on a seatbelt, changed his life forever. Paddy told us how he coped with the aftermath of a horrific accident. Englishman Grenville Cole is currently enjoying a second competitive swimming career. He first discovered the sport as a child over 70 years ago, when he used it to help him recover from a severe case of diptheria. Now 85, he is breaking records all over again. In his late teens Joe Williams seemed to have it all, good looks, an adoring fan base and plenty of money as a star player in a Sydney rugby club. He was also a role model for members of his Waidjuri aboriginal group from New South Wales. But secretly he was struggling with depression and addiction.
