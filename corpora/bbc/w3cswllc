The border between the USA and Mexico is a highly controversial and sometimes dangerous place. Francisco Cantú has always been fascinated by that border. His family migrated from Mexico to the US, but he went on to join the Border Patrol which aims to stop illegal immigration. The experience left deep scars on him. Bolivia is famous for its spectacular mountain scenery, which attracts climbers from all over the world. Often their base camps are staffed by the Aymara women, also known as Cholitas. You can't miss them because they wear skirts in vibrant colours and tiny bowler hats. They used to be confined to cooking for the expeditions, but now, thanks to the pioneering work of one of them, Lydia Huayllas, they climb to the heights with the men. Jane Chambers went to meet her. Seven years ago, Jamie McKechnie was the victim of an unprovoked attack in London and suffered a serious brain injury. He was in a coma for nine weeks and doctors gave him a 30 percent chance of surviving. Jamie's girlfriend, soul singer Ellen Murphy - who goes by the name Only Girl - describes how she used music to help Jamie in his recovery. Image: Francisco Cantú Credit: Beowulf Sheehan Show less
