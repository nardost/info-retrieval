On the 26th November 2008 gunmen stormed the Indian city of Mumbai. It was the start of a brutal siege that killed over 150 people and injured many more. Professor PV Viswanath found himself in the middle of one of the hostage negotiations that day. He was nearly 8000 miles away in New York City. In North London there's a musician with some slightly bizarre muses. When Cosmo Sheldrake composes a song, he doesn't always use traditional instruments. Instead he uses fish, pigs or even stars. Outlook's Mariana Des Forges went to investigate. André Leon Talley is an icon in the fashion world. His early jobs include working for Andy Warhol in New York in the 70s. He went on to become editor-at-large at the most famous fashion magazine in the world: Vogue. He is now the subject of the documentary The Gospel According to André. His story begins in a church in Durham, North Carolina.
