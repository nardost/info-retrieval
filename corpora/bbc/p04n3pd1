This month Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. What does it take to do one of the most powerful jobs in the world? Bridget Kendall is joined by four prominent American experts in political history and journalism - the BBCâ€™s White House correspondent Tara McKelvey, public policy specialist Elaine Kamarck, historian and analyst Aaron David Miller and professor of History, Journalism and Media Studies David Greenberg. They discuss what the job involves, what powers the American President has, and how these have changed over the years to reflect the demands of the modern world. (Photo: Win McNamee.
