Last year we brought you the extraordinary story of the Indian inventor who came up with a simple machine that women can use to make and sell sanitary pads. For thousands of them, it's a life changing device. The story got a huge reaction. One person it inspired was a yoga teacher from the UK called Amy Peake. She decided she wanted to take the machines into refugee camps. Some people thought she was crazy but she didn't give up, and last month she travelled to the Zaatari camp in Jordan, where 80,000 Syrian refugees live. Twenty-five years ago a British expedition unearthed a unique bird's wing in the mud of the plains of Ethiopia. It was the only evidence of the existence of the Nechisar Nightjar - a species of bird that had never been seen before. And as the years passed this single bird's wing became a totem for devoted birdwatchers like the Vernon Head from South Africa, who set off on a mission to find the elusive bird. Mai Masri is a Palestinian documentary film-maker who has just made her first feature film - 3000 Nights. It is set in a women's prison in Nablus in the 1980s and draws on Mai's personal experiences and those of the cast, as she told the BBC's Hilary Dunn. New Yorker Steve Versano has made a career out of selling private jets and he has opened a showroom right in the middle of the British capital for all the billionaires, princes and oligarchs who pass through. He gave Matthew Bannister a tour of his showroom which features a mock up of the inside of a private jet. (Photo: British Yoga teacher Amy Peake who is bringing sanitary pads to refugees.
