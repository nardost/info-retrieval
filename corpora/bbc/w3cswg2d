Chinese reporter Haining Liu was born into the ‘one-child generation’ in the early 1980s. She explores how these political, social and economic changes have affected the relationship between old and young in China. Haining looks at family life, marriage, divorce, dating, opportunities for women, and how being from the one-child generation has affected her and her peers. In a village in the mountains outside Beijing she hears from a great grandma in her 80s and four generations of one family to find out just how much things have changed in this vast country.
