As we look forward to the World Water Forum, one of the biggest meetings about water in the world, we discuss the importance of this precious resource. Usha Rao-Monari, who's Global Head of Water at the International Finance Corporation, argues that water is a key factor in the economic growth of a nation. Zambian Martin Mulenga, a sanitation and water supply expert, discusses the challenges of providing access to safe and clean water to those living in slums. And the leading American visual artist Roni Horn shares with us her life-long fascination with water, which she describes as the ultimate seduction. Illustration by Laura Morris. Show less
