Hamza and Waad al-Khateab lived in Aleppo through some of the most intense moments of the Syrian war. Hamza was a doctor and Waad a citizen journalist. Through the siege and bombardments they fell in love. So, how do you start a family in a warzone? Jo Fidgen hears their story. Waad has made a documentary about their life in Aleppo called For Sama. The film is produced by Channel 4 News and ITN Productions. Isa√≠ Madriz is an entomologist, or insect specialist, from Mexico. He risks his life exploring remote areas of Chilean Patagonia to try to discover new insects. Carolyn Shoemaker is an American astronomer and a record-breaking comet discoverer, so much so that she has the nickname Mrs Comet. Carolyn and her husband Eugene were something of an astronomy power couple - he was a pioneering planetary scientist and wanted to be the first man on the moon. An illness held Eugene back, but after his death, his ashes were launched into space and he's the only human to be 'buried' on the moon. Outlook's Saskia Edwards has the story.
