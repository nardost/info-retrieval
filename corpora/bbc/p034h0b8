Nearly 40 years ago, French polymath Jacques Attali wrote a book called Noise which predicted a "crisis of proliferation" for recorded music â€“ in which its value would plummet. As music sales went into free-fall at the turn of the century, his prediction seemed eerily resonant to up-and-coming singer-songwriter Sam York. Now struggling to earn a living as a musician, York visits Attali to help get an insight into his own future, and learns that music itself may hold clues to what is about to happen in the wider world. Along the way, York meets Al Doyle from Hot Chip and folk singer Frank Turner, who reveal that - despite being relatively well known - they still find it difficult to earn a living from their "stardom". Doyle says he struggled to afford a one-bedroom flat in London. It is a world away from the rock-and-roll lifestyle we might think successful musicians enjoy. (Photo: Sam York in studio) Show less
