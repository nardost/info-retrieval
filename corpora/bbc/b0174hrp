Laurie Taylor examines the limits of science and the machine age with writer Bryan Appleyard and philosopher John Gray and asks whether we are in danger of losing the essence of what it is to be human. And, kiss me quick hats, fortune tellers and buckets and spades. The cliched pleasures of the English seaside. But are those delights equally available to all? The seaside is traditionally inhabited by majority white populations, many of whom are older and retired. And although increasing numbers of ethnic minorities visit and reside by the coast, it remains stubbornly white in our collective imagination. New research by Dr Daniel Burdsey claims that our nation's identity is bound up with monocultural images of coastal resorts. Producer: Chris Wilson. Show less
