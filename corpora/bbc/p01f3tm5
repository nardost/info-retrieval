Baroness Helen Newlove describes how her husband Garry was murdered by three teenagers after confronting a group of vandals outside his home in Warrington in northwest England. It was an event that shocked Britain, and inspired her to devote her life to campaigning against anti-social behaviour, and for the rights of victims of crime. She has written a memoir about her experiences called It Could Happen to You. Also, a report from the Rwandan Film Festival shows how film-makers there are helping to heal the wounds left by the genocide. Teenager Krsna Kothari from New York tells us why she's determined to clean up the streets of the Indian town, Indore. And Chachi and Robin Valencia, otherwise known as The Rocketman Valencia and The Shooting Star - the circus performers who are human cannonballs!
