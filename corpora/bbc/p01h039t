Calligrapher Ewan Clayton tells us how he went from an English monastery to 1980s California, where he worked with digital pioneers. His book is called "The Golden Thread". Also, we hear from the Laotian women who clear farmers' fields of the unexploded bombs that still kill and maim. We celebrate Bosnian cinema with film-makers at the Sarajevo Festival and hear the extraordinary story of how Rwanda's cycling team was formed. Picture: Calligrapher and teacher Ewan Clayton Show less
