Ugandan Susan Kigula was a young mother when she was sentenced to hang for murder. She always maintained her innocence and sang songs of sorrow in a choir she formed with her fellow inmates on death row. Behind bars Susan also started a school and completed a law degree, but it's what she did next which would change the lives of more than 400 other inmates, as well as the law of the land.
