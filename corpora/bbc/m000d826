Laurence Scott hears about a pioneer of vegetarianism and advocates for nudism and camping as the academics Elsa Richardson, Annebella Pollen and Ben Anderson discuss the Life Reform Movement. Ideas included arguments for a basic income, clean eating, yoga, world peace and what a perfect body looked like. The movement emerged in the second half of the 19th century and was a loose collection of groups and individuals who pursued social reform of all kinds but their ideas were both utopian and had their darker side. Annebella Pollen teaches at Brighton University and is the author of The Kindred of the Kibbo Kift: Intellectual Barbarians Elsa Richardson teaches at the University of Strathclyde and is a New Generation Thinker on the scheme run by the BBC and AHRC to promote research on radio. Ben Anderson teaches at Keele University and is also a New Generation Thinker.
