The murder of 38-year-old Marielle Franco in March this year sent shockwaves across the city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. A rising star on the political scene, Marielle had just been chosen by the Party for Socialism and Liberty to be its candidate for deputy governor. She was an unusual politician in many ways as she was the only black woman out of 51 councillors in Rio, lesbian, and from a very poor background. No-one has yet been charged for her murder. Marielle's partner Monica Benicio shares her memories of Marielle with us. Outlook Inspirations nominee Emma Carey grew up in the Australian capital Canberra and was obsessed with sport. While holidaying in Switzerland, she got to fulfil one of her dreams: skydiving. However, things took a horrible turn. Emma's parachute and the emergency backup had become tangled around her instructor and he was unconscious. They crashed to the ground. She survived but with terrible injuries. As she recovered she began to share her story of learning to walk and live again.
