Pictured: Gay Byrne Matthew Bannister on Gay Byrne, the Irish TV and radio presenter who occupied a unique place in the nation's culture and public life. He presented the Late Late Show for thirty-seven years, often causing controversy when he covered changing social issues. Sadako Ogata, the Japanese academic who served as UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the 1990s. She was noted for her fearless approach and for putting the refugee crisis on the political map. The current Commissioner recalls his time working with her. And the Hollywood producer Robert Evans, who was behind classic films like The Godfather, Love Story and Chinatown, but was almost as well known for his colourful private life as his on-screen hits. The actor and director Simon McBurney pays tribute.
