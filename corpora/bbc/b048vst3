Racing driver Jackie Stewart discusses his good friend King Hussein of Jordan with journalist Patrick Seale. From 2001. Racing driver Jackie Stewart nominates King Hussein of Jordan, a man he came to know as a friend, and who he believes led a great life. When King Hussein died in 1999, he had ruled his country for 46 years, survived the tumultuous politics of the Middle East and numerous assassination attempts. Jackie met the ruler early in his career, because King Hussein was a motor sport enthusiast, and he remembers a generous host, who gave good advice. Joan Bakewell and Jackie Stewart are joined by journalist Patrick Seale, a long time chronicler of Middle East affairs. Patrick argues that, while King Hussein was a well-mannered man and formidable politician, there was a wily side. Show less
