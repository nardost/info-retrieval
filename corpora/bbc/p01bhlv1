***Some listeners may find parts of this report upsetting.*** Outlook's Jo Fidgen follows the Norwegian fishermen who kill around 500 minke whales and sell the meat. They explain why whaling is central to their communities. We meet two long distance travellers who covered thousands of miles for different reasons. Listen to the Punjabi man walked 10,000 miles from England to his birthplace in India, he said he wanted to get rid of an 'empty feeling' by walking. And, hear the story of Oli Broom, who cycled 14,000 miles, through 23 countries to attend The Ashes test cricket series in Australia. Plus, Henning Mankell - the best-selling Swedish crime writer on his most famous character Inspector Kurt Wallander and his own life in Sweden and Africa.
