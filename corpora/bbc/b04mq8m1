Karen Armstrong, one of the world's leading thinkers about religion, gives the Free Thinking Lecture, arguing that, in the current global situation, a recognition of how little we know is the only way to peace. A former Roman Catholic nun, Armstrong has addressed members of the US congress. She was appointed by Kofi Annan to join the United Nations group 'The Alliance of Civilisation' and, in 2008, won the TED prize. She is the author of more than 20 books on faith, including The Case For God and Fields of Blood: Religion and the History of Violence. She talks to Rana Mitter and takes questions from the audience. Recorded earlier this evening in front of an audience at BBC Radio 3's Free Thinking Festival of Ideas 2014 from Sage Gateshead. Producer: Fiona McLean. Show less
