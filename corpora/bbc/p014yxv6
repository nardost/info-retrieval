The lifeguard and paramedic who tried to rescue a swimmer attacked by sharks off the New Zealand coast. An Indian bodybuilder who innocently befriended one of the men behind the attacks on Mumbai - and so became a suspect himself - tells Jo Fidgen he feels betrayed. And a broken-hearted musician from Argentina who set up a club for unhappy men shares his tips on how to win over a woman's heart. Picture: Muriwai Bay by sunset.
