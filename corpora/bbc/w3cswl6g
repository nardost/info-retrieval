Alyson Deussen and Jill Rowe are both members of the Mormon church which opposes gay sex and marriage. But Alyson and Jill have ended up fighting for their gay sons and are part of a group called Mama Dragons - it's made up of members of the Mormon church who want the church to do more, to be more accepting of LGBTQ youth. Not only have they become friends, but when they're not meeting and supporting each other, they're lobbying the church. Gerardo Weiss is known as the Beatles barber of Buenos Aires. Since he became obsessed with the Fab Four over 40 years ago, he's been collecting more and more Beatles music, merchandise and memorabilia. His hair salon has now become famous as a shrine to the group. Dr John Rice is a retired surgeon whose specialism is the ear and he's known for doing some of the first cochlear implants in Australia. A cochlear implant is an electronic device that can be fitted to your head to help you hear. John has done nearly 60 operations since the early 1990s - mostly on very young children. He told Emily Webb how it all started. Image: (L) Jill Rowe and (R) Alyson Deussen Credit: Jill Rowe and Alyson Deussen Show less
