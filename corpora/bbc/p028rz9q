Footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed during an FA cup quarter final match in 2012 - his heart stopped for 78 minutes. It was an event which transformed his life. Fabrice and his wife Shauna tell Matthew Bannister their story. Simitie Lavaly works for a charity in Freetown, Sierra Leone, that is helping people who have fallen foul of the new emergency anti-ebola regulations. Dame Vivienne Westwood is one of the most controversial names in fashion. She is also a committed anarchist and is famous for her role in the British punk music scene of the 1970s. She's now in her 70s, and has just published a memoir. In 1976 American orthopaedic surgeon Jim Styner was flying his family in a light plane when it crashed, killing his wife. The treatment that Jim and his children received in hospital led him to develop a new set of protocols that teach medics how to help patients at the scene of a major trauma.
