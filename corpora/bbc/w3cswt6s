For over 15 years, Shuhood Abader was a poacher, risking his life in Cape Townâ€™s shark-infested waters to hunt a strange sea creature known as abalone. It's a type of rare shellfish that's so sought after that the illegal trade is now a multi-million dollar industry. It's a dangerous world that Shuhood struggled to leave behind.
