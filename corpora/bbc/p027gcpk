Cells working together to build a human embryo, a swarm of bees, robots joining forces to explore challenging terrain. These are all examples of self assembly â€“ the coming together of simple units to form something of great complexity. To explore this wide-ranging area of research Bridget Kendall is joined by experimental biologist Jamie Davies, chemical engineer and physicist Sharon Glotzer and robotics engineer Roderich Gross.
