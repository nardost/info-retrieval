Last Broadcast Date: Fri 21 Jun 2013
Guor Marial describes his long and hazardous journey to get to the Olympics, after his family were caught up in the Sudanese civil war and he had to flee his home. He became known as the olympic athlete without a country. The marathon runner had to run in the London 2012 games under the Olympic flag because his home state of South Sudan was so new that it didn't have a recognised Olympic committee. Also on the programme, music from Afghanistan's first rock band, Kabul Dreams, and a perspective on challenging attitudes and traditions. Their debut album is called Plastic Words. Kenyan entrepreneur Jamila Abass explains how she is helping farmers with the latest mobile technology. Plus, a film about Neil Platt, a young father dying of Motor Neurone Disease called I Am Breathing - we hear from his widow Louise and co-director Emma Davie. And, in Witness, memories of the Nicaraguan civil war from President Somoza's personal pilot. Show less
