Lee Parker was homeless and rifling through a dustbin in Elizabeth, New Jersey when he came across a rather heavy bag. When he looked inside he saw what he thought were "decorated candles" but in fact it was a bomb. Lee has now been hailed a hero after he calmly dealt with the bag - and bomb - and made sure it was as far away from people as possible. Growing up in a middle class area of Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, Chandramani Thenuara was expected to get married and settle down. Instead she travelled the world and came to England to study art & textiles. Chandramani went on to revolutionise the Sri Lankan sari -- reviving handloom weaving and changing the way colour is used. Our reporter Nicki Paxman went to meet her and hear her story. Avelino Mendes Fortuna spends much of his time travelling around his homeland Brazil. He's on a mission he inherited from his eldest son, Lucas. Lucas was just 28 when he was murdered in 2012. He was gay, and a gay rights activist, and his father believes that may have been the motive behind his killing. Avelino tells Jo Fidgen how much his son's death has changed his life. Ed Cage and Nicole Paris are a father a daughter from the American city of St Louis...and they have an unusual talent - they are beatboxers and they've taken the internet by storm. We find out why.
