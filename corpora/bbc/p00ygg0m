As the Libyan government tries to persuade former fighters to hand in their weapons, we bring together a campaigner who's helping to disarm the militias and a man who still keeps an arsenal at home. Also, a homeless tour guide in the Czech capital Prague reveals a grittier side to the city. We hear from the Pakistani man whose moustache was declared 'un-Islamic' by the Taliban, who shaved it off at gunpoint. And, to mark the 90th anniversary of BBC Radio, our listeners send us their messages for people tuning in in 90 yearsâ€™ time. Show less
