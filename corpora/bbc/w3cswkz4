Humberto Restrepo from Medellin in Colombia is a locksmith by day, but outside his working hours he plays Cupid by writing love letters for other couples. As Outlook's Clayton Conn found out, Humberto has saved many relationships in trouble. When Tish Hevel's beloved dad died in 2015, she wanted to do something in his memory, something that would reflect the kind of person he had been. She decided to donate his brain to science to help in the study of Lewy body dementia and has now founded the Brain Donor Project. In the 1960s, Bonga Kuenda emerged from the shantytowns of Angola to become the fastest sprinter in the Portuguese Empire. He was also a very well known semba singer - who put his voice to the cause of Angola's independence. Outlook's Harry Graham has been hearing his story. (Photo: Humberto Restrepo.
