Jocelyn Chng runs a food company which is now worth millions of dollars, but it started as a small family business that produced one type of soy sauce. Jocelyn Chng overcame prejudice and personal grief to create a global brand. Cecilia Bembibre is a doctoral student using innovative means to collect and preserve smells that she fears may die out. Mitsuhide and Mikiko Ikeda run a farm near the town of Okuma, just six kilometres from the Fukushima nuclear plant which was devastated by the earthquake and tsunami of 2011. The area around the plant is now an exclusion zone with the population evacuated and government instructions to kill contaminated livestock. The Ikedas are ignoring those instructions and return every day to look after their beloved cows. Suhail Yusuf Khan comes from a family of famous Indian classical sarangi players. This traditional multi-stringed instrument made international stars of both his grandfather and uncle. Although Suhail learnt the traditional craft, he has chosen to fuse ancient Indian rhythms with Western rock and pop and has collaborated with folk musicians to create the band Yorkston/Thorne/Khan.
