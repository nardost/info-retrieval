Sweden received more asylum seekers per capita than any other country last year. But an open borders policy was slowly rowed back as accommodation started to run out and the authorities struggled to cope with the arrival of so many newcomers. It is not just cities like Stockholm and Malmo that have seen an influx of newcomers. Ã…nge is a community of 9,000 people in the north of Sweden which is now home to 1,000 asylum seekers. An hour's drive away from the nearest big city, it is a place of picturesque natural beauty, but where in winter the sun sets as early as 2.30 in the afternoon and temperatures can plunge to as low as -30C. Keith Moore spends time in the community with locals and asylum seekers as they get used to the each other and to their new lives.
