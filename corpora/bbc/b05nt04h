In this programme about public and private art, Philip Dodd talks to Nicholas Penny, the outgoing Director of the National Gallery. In the interview Penny explains why he thinks "it's really important to be unkind about contemporary art" and why if you do not like the National Gallery collection "you should perhaps try harder". Philip also talks to the global art collector and private museum owner Budi Tek about why he thinks ticket prices are important to keep people from coming into his museums simply to take advantage of the air conditioning.
