Nathi Mankayi spent four years in a South African prison. Heâ€™s now a music sensation. In South Africa, Nathi Mankayi has been winning millions of fans, and many awards, with his heartfelt songs. He writes them from experience and he has had quite an experience. Poverty, crime and an eight-year prison sentence. But in just a few years he's gone from inmate to one of South Africa's top selling recording artists. Outlook's Mpho Lakaje spoke to him. A slum in Kanpur northwest India is home to a remarkable woman called Kalavati. She is poor and illiterate but she's transformed her community through sheer determination. Her mission is to provide safe and sanitary toilets for the people around her. Egyptian Passante Adel is the first Arab woman to become a free-dive instructor and she's got an incredible ability to go down to deep depths for minutes at a time with no oxygen tank . However, just a few years ago she was absolutely petrified of the water and couldn't swim at all. The source of the problem was a terrifying experience in the sea when she was seven years old.
