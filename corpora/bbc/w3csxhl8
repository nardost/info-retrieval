The opioid epidemic in America is hurting all levels of society – in this three part documentary series we explore its impact, in real-time, on people in one city, Louisville, Kentucky. We work with a team of reporters on the Louisville Courier Journal as they follow opioid stories across the community – in particular, how it is affecting schools and colleges, as well as health care, law and order and prisons. Over six weeks, beginning mid-August at the start of the new school semester, we follow the reporters who have been covering the opioid epidemic in a state which was one of the first to be hit hard by a problem which started with over-prescribing of prescription drugs, and has now spread to become a major urban crisis.
