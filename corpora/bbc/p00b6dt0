This BBC World Service series has been tracking the lives of East Londoners living on a deprived housing estate, in the shadow of the 2012 Olympic Park for the past two years. The BBC's Nina Robinson reports. Episode 3: Gardens of Paradise Olympics officials and politicians want people to get involved in the excitement of it all, but locals from East London's deprived neighbours are not all buying in to the glossy media campaign. Locals say that tickets will be expensive and because those on low incomes will need to work, they will not be able to take part by volunteering. Resident Darrell James says "They have turned an industrial site into a garden of paradise." "If they can do that for the Olympic village, why can't they do that for a place where people actually live and breathe and pay taxes?" (Image: Flowers throughout the Olympic site.
