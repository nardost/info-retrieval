Nigerian Ruona Meyer was inspired by her famous journalist father – Godwin Agbroko - to become an investigative reporter like him. When he was killed, her grieving brother became addicted to codeine cough syrup. Ruona – clad in bullet proof vest and blue lipstick – risked her life to uncover the black market trade in the medicine that’s become a street drug. Her documentary Sweet, Sweet Codeine has been nominated for an Emmy. Havana, the capital of Cuba, has its very own personal historian: Eusebio Leal. He’s spent 30 years overseeing the restoration of the city’s historic centre and is the go-to tour guide when any important visitor comes to town – from Barack Obama to the Pope. His passion for Old Havana started young, and he went to extreme lengths to protect its streets – even blocking the path of a bulldozer. Outlook’s Jane Chambers reports.
