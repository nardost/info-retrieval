Tanzin Norbu grew up in the ancient Himalayan kingdom of Zanskar, now part of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. His village is so remote and high up in the mountains that it is cut off from the rest of the world for seven months of the year. In 1981, when Tanzin was seven years old, his parents decided it was time to send him to school. But the nearest one was five days walk away, across a notoriously dangerous mountain pass. In the 1980s Cass Pennant was one of the leaders of a notorious gang of football hooligans linked to the London club West Ham United. At 20 years old he was the first person in the UK to go to prison for football hooligan related violence. But now he has turned his life around and become a writer and film producer. His own life story has even been turned into a movie. The Croatian playwright Tena Stivicic has drawn on her own family history to create a new play about the tumultuous last century of the former Yugoslavia. Three Winters considers the impact the changes in the country have on four generations of women. During rehearsals a picture of Tena's great grandmother was hung on the wall to inspire the actors.
