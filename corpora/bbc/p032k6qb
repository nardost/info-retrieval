In April, an earthquake which devastated parts of Nepal killed 22 people on Mount Everest. Ang Kami Sherpa watched in horror as his friends were swept away by the avalanche. But now he is back up the mountain carrying out his work as an 'Icefall Doctor'. He's one of a team of specialist Sherpa mountaineers who prepare the trails for climbers trying to scale the world's highest mountain. This summer Mike Andrews from Bristol in the west of England finally completed a 40,000 mile adventure he started 55 years ago. In the early 1960s, Mike and three of his university friends set off to drive from the southernmost tip of Latin America to Alaska. But bad weather and lack of a road meant they never reached their destination. Decades later a stroke of luck meant they could complete their trip. The artist Ai Wei Wei is arguably China's best known dissident. For years he was subjected to surveillance and harassment and then - in 2011 - the Chinese authorities detained him for 81 days without charge. After his release his movements were still restricted. Then this July, Ai Wei Wei had his passport returned to him, which meant he could travel to London where for the first time work from across his career is on show at the Royal Academy of Arts. As a teenager Lillian Kelle became famous in her native Uganda as one half of the singing duo Prim N Propa. Now she lives with her family in the United States. But, despite her success, for most of her life Lillian has wrestled with a terrible secret. As a child she was abused in her own home. It was only recently that she revealed her troubled past in a memoir. Now she's written a book for children which teaches them about the issue of abuse.
