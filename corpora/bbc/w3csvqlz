Mustafa Nader grew up in war-torn Iraq, but he didn't want the pages of his diary to be filled with the violence he saw, he wanted to reflect the peaceful side of life there too. Professor Ibrahima Thiaw is a Senegalese archaeologist who dives for sunken slave ships, despite being terrified of the sea. Up-and-coming British actor Irfan Shamji had just got a lucky break playing opposite a Hollywood star, and was on top of the world, when he heard about a devastating fire in his neighbourhood in west London. Clare Kines was posted to Arctic Bay for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police nearly 20 years ago and never left. He spends his time taking people on tours to see the birdlife, and photographing the exquisite light in the summer when the sun never sets, and in the winter when it doesn't rise at all.
