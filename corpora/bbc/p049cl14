Being a fire fighter in Kabul means much more than just putting out fires. Abdul Aziz Oryakhil has been in the job for nearly 30 years. Part of his work is to attend suicide bombings and clean up the aftermath. Kenyan artist Shine Tani has had his work shown around the world. But the self-taught painter once performed on the street and begged for money. Now, he's successful enough to build a large gallery in Banana Hill, just outside Nairobi. Are Feyisetan is the not-so-secret weapon on the side of Nigeria's Paralympic powerlifting team. He helped them return from Rio with nine medals despite their financial challenges. Maxina Hunt is a Canadian vet who has set up a service for the remote Inuit people of Labrador and Newfoundland. Image: Fire fighters in Kabul Credit Majid Saeedi/GettyImages Show less
