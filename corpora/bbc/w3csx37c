Habula Karamat is 81 years old and lives in Guyana. She has eight children – but none of them live in her home country. All eight emigrated, in search of a better life overseas. They include the mother of BBC reporter Tiffany Sweeney, who was born and brought up in the UK. For the first time as an adult, Tiffany travels to Guyana with her mother. She learns about what impelled her mother to leave and what she gained by the transition - but also what was lost. The three generations of women discuss the wrenching compromises that accompany migration. How did Tiffany’s mother integrate in western society alone with no parents? And how did their struggles and choices shape Tiffany’s life? Producer: Elizabeth Cassin (Photo: Maureen Dasilva Peers, Habula Karamat and Tiffany Sweeney) Show less
