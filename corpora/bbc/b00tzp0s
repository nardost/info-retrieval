Also Catherine Walker, the discreet fashion designer who created spectacular dresses for Diana Princess of Wales. Jimi Heselden, the self made businessman from Yorkshire who gave millions to charity and died whilst out riding his Segway scooter And the self styled King of the Buskers Don Partridge who had a hit in the late sixties with the single "Rosie".
