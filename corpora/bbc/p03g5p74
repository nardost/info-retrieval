Impersonators, imposters, con-artists and entertainers â€“ those people who pretend to be who they are not. Some do it for financial gain, some to pay tribute to a music icon and some simply to raise a laugh. But what happens when people start to believe their own stories, start to believe their fantasy life is real? It is mainly men who pose as police officers, soldiers, special forces: figures with a badge, a uniform, some aura of authority. Mike Williams explores what motivates people to be somebody they are not. (Photo: David Boakes impersonating Michael Jackson. Credit to Mike Williams) Show less
