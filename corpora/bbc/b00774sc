THE DEATH OF HONOUR Is honour dead? In our society of celebrity worship, therapy, self absorption and shopping, what meaning does the concept of honour have? James Bowman, Research Scholar at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington and author of Honor: A History and Anthony Grayling, Professor of Philosophy at the Birkbeck, University of London explore the idea of respect and what it means on an East London Estate. They discuss the idea of honour and respect as outmoded concepts or keys to understanding aspects of the modern world. RESPECT IN TOWER HAMLETS According to some new research, “a culture of respect is already very much present amongst young people within the inner-city and within inner-city schools, but it is one that places an emphasis on violence, a violent image and a lack of hope in ‘conventional norms’ such as achievement ideology.” Laurie Taylor is joined by Dr Carolyn Gaskell, ESRC Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of London to discuss her recently published paper entitled “But They Just Don’t Respect Us”: Young People’s Experiences of (Dis) Respected Citizenship and the New Labour Agenda.
