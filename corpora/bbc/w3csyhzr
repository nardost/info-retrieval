Sean Sweeney works as an Australian sign language (Auslan) interpreter for the Rural Fire Service (RFS) in New South Wales, Australia. During the recent Australian bushfires, he helped interpret vital public announcements for deaf residents of the state. Sean was born hearing into a family where many of the members are deaf. At home, sign language was his first language. Yet Sean drifted away from his family for some years, before returning to train as an interpreter – something which deepened his command of the language and allowed him to re-connect with his father. By 2019, having established himself as a professional interpreter, Sean got a call from a colleague at the RFS. Bushfires were raging across New South Wales and Australia, and they needed an interpreter to help get the message out. Sean tells Outlook’s Emily Webb about his crucial role in the recent bushfires in Australia. Judith Sheindlin is better known as Judge Judy, the name she uses in her court arbitration television show in the US. But after nearly 25 years, it’s been recently announced that the show is coming to an end. Judge Judy spoke to Jack Stewart for Outlook back in 2015. Dr Roberto Anfosso is an Italian doctor who makes all of his home-visits on the back of his horse Ambra. If you call on Roberto, expect him to arrive with the stethoscope in his saddle-bag.
