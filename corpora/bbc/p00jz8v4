On today's special edition of Outlook Jo Fidgen travels to Gander in Newfoundland, where the population doubled on 11 September 2001. Planes carrying thousands of passengers were diverted there because of the attacks on New York and Washington. The people of Gander opened up their homes, came out with food and gave up their own beds to strangers from almost 100 countries. We speak to a passenger, a pilot and an air traffic controller, as well as the residents of Gander about their memories of the day and feelings about 9/11 ten years on.
