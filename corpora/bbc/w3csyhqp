Badiucao is one of China's most famous dissident cartoonists. His art is political and provocative, and pokes fun at powerful Chinese figures, even President Xi Jinping. For years, Badiucao operated in secrecy: he moved into exile in Australia, and wore a mask at public events to conceal his identity. But since Badiucao last spoke to Outlook in 2017, the price he pays for making art has become even higher. Scientist Joel Berger has dedicated ten years of his life to studying muskoxen - the hairy Arctic relatives of the goat. With global warming affecting their habitat, muskoxen have increasingly come into contact with roaming polar bears. Joel wanted to investigate the effect of the bears on muskoxen behaviour - and with no polar bear to call on - he improvised. He grabbed his polar bear costume and headed north. When Patricia Matoloengwe moved to Cape Town, she lived in a shack. It was the only place she could afford, and it was dangerous and unsuitable. She tried lobbying the government for better conditions, but they didn't listen. So she took matters into her own hands, and led a group of local women into action. Outlook's Gavin Fischer went to meet Patricia. (Image: Badiucao with one of his artworks. Photo credit: Getty Images.) Show less
