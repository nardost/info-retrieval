Monika Glennon is a Polish-born estate agent living in the US. One morning she got a frantic call from a colleague: an explicit post had been written about Monika, claiming she had an affair with a client and that she was a ‘homewrecker’. The story was fabricated, but as it became the first hit when you googled her name, Monika began to lose business, fell into a depression, and even feared for her life. Who was behind the post? She tells Jo Fidgen her shocking story. Anastasia Allison is a violinist and Rose Freeman plays the piano. They're keen climbers, and they met through their love of the Cascade Mountains of Washington State. As their friendship grew, they decided to don their concert gowns under their ski jackets, take their instruments up with them and play. They now perform in the remote wilderness as the Musical Mountaineers. (Image: Monika Glennon. Photo credit: Rich Ortiz.) Show less
