Unemployment rates in India have shot up in recent years, and around twice as many women are out of work compared with their male counterparts. Divya Arya travels across India meeting some of the women who are challenging gender stereotypes and breaking down social taboos in order to find work in areas traditionally the preserve of men. She speaks to one of Delhi’s very few female mechanics at Asia’s biggest truck park, goes to a training day with the first female firefighter in Jaipur and meets the child bride who has found a new life as a taxi driver. Rajasthan has the highest rate of child marriage in the country and learning to drive a taxi is helping some women to achieve financial and emotional independence. Divya also travels to the hi-tech capital of Bangalore and meets a young woman breaking the gender stereotype by forging a career in computer gaming. And, she speaks to those capitalising on India’s booming night life economy and working as female bouncers. (Photo: A female mechanic works on fixing car) Show less
