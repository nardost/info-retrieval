Twenty-five years after independence, Audrey Brown travels to Namibia to explore the kind of lives lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transsexual people are carving out in a society where homosexuality is not forbidden but where widespread social disapproval makes it difficult for them to live as fully free human beings. Audrey spends time with Zoe, a young lesbian who had a child in order to hide her sexuality. She travels with Linda, to learn how activists are drawing on Namibia's history of fighting against oppression under apartheid South Africa to reach out to communities who reject them. And she meets Deyonce, a transwoman who refuses to compromise who she is, despite hostility from her own family. Show less
