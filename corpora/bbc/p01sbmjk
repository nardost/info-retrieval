They are Asia’s economic giants – yet the historical record of Japan and China continues to cause tensions. In part two, Japanese journalist Mariko Oi and Chinese journalist Haining Liu, travel around China, including the city of Nanjing, where Japanese forces committed rapes and mass killings during the war. They explore how events like these are remembered in modern China and ask why the young Chinese can consume Japanese pop culture while demonstrating against Japan’s historical record.
