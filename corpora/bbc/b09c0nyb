David Hendy, Glyn Maxwell, Kate Kennedy and Lucy Walker with Philip Dodd and an audience at Aldeburgh in a discussion exploring Britten's relationship with radio in Britain and in America, with his subjects as varied as mountaineering (with words from Christopher Isherwood), a dramatisation of Homer's Odyssey and short stories by D.H. Lawrence (with a young W.H. Auden). But why was Britten so reluctant to accept a job at the BBC's Music department in the 1930s? David Hendy is a historian of the BBC and Professor of Media and Cultural History at the University of Sussex. Glyn Maxwell is a poet and librettist who has traced the journey of Auden and MacNeice to Iceland. Kate Kennedy is a biographer and editor of the forthcoming 'Literary Britten', Lucy Walker is Director of Programmes and Learning at the Britten-Pears Foundation. Recorded in front of an audience as part of the Britten on the Radio weekend at the Britten Studio at Snape Maltings. Producer: Fiona McLean. Show less
