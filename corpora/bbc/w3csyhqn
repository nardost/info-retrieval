When so-called Islamic State attacked northern Iraq, Hogir Hirori - a documentary maker and refugee from the region - went back there to record what was going on. He came across a young girl who was seriously ill, and decided to drop everything to help her. But then she vanished. And Hogir now had a mystery to solve. He's made a film about what happened called The Girl Who Saved My Life. You might catch Thomas Panek running through a park in Westchester County, just outside New York City. He’s confident, with a dog running alongside him. But this is a partnership that’s unusual because Thomas isn’t leading the dog, the dog is leading him. Thomas is blind and through his running, ended up making history. Outlook’s Jason Strother went for a run with him. 88-year-old Hsi-huang Chen is one of the few traditional puppet masters left in Taiwan. Known as Budaixi, traditional puppet theatre is a kind of epic opera performed with glove puppets on a portable ornate wooden stage. For centuries, Budaixi was one of the most popular forms of entertainment in Taiwan, until modern forms of entertainment won people over. Despite his age, Mr. Chen is on a mission to save Budaixi from extinction. Outlook's Cindy Sui went to meet him. Image: Souad Credit: Hogir Hirori Show less
