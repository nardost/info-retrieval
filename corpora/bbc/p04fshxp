Melissa Dohme from Florida was viciously attacked by her ex-boyfriend and left for dead. But against all the odds she survived. Now she's found love in an unlikely place. Leif Cocks from Australia has spent most of his life with orangutans - first as the head orangutan keeper at Perth Zoo, and now leading a conservation project in Sumatra where these primates are considered critically endangered. Leif and his team help to rehabilitate orangutans who have been kept in captivity so they can go out to live in the forests of Indonesia. He's written a book called Orangutan, My Cousins, My Friends. For centuries, people in Europe have been playing the pipe organ. But over the last couple of decades, one pipe organ in Germany began to go wrong. The problems of the organ at the St Jakobi Church in Luebeck, which is more than 500 years old, started an international search to diagnose a mystery issue which could affect instruments across the continent. We talk to church organist and research engineer Carl Johan Bergsten. (Photo: Melissa Dohme. Credit: Melissa Dohme) Show less
