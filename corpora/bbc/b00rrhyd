In a special edition of Start the Week recorded at Lambeth Palace, Andrew Marr talks to the Archbishop of Canterbury about his role combining the history and structure of the church with personal belief. They are joined by Philip Pullman who was inspired by Dr Rowan Williams to write his new book The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ about religion, truth and interpretation; by Professor Mona Siddiqui who'll be discussing her new role trying to marry religious values with economic growth and by author and comedian David Baddiel who'll be talking about religious identity and his new film The Infidel, a comedy about a Muslim who realises he's Jewish.
