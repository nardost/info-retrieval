JESSICA JORDAN BURTON Twenty six year old Jessica Jordan Burton has had rather an unusual career path. A former Miss Universe contestant, she is now a powerful political figure in Bolivia. She has been appointed by Bolivian President Evo Morales as his special envoy in the border province of Beni - an area notorious as a base for money launderers and cocaine dealers. She tells Jo Fidgen what made her decide to trade beauty pageants for politics. MORAKOT TYPHOON In August last year, Taiwan experienced its worst typhoon in half a century - Typhoon Morakot.
