Racism in Hong Kong? British writer Martin Jacques talks about his ten year campaign to prove his wife's death in a Hong Kong hospital was due to racism and clinical negligence. Martin's wife Hari was a Malaysian born Indian. She was in her early thirties when the couple moved to Hong Kong with their baby son Ravi in 1998. On Millenium Eve - the night of 31st December 1999 - Hari suffered an epileptic fit and was taken to hospital. Forty-eight hours later, she died. Martin was convinced that something was wrong with her treatment and started a campaign to hold the hospital authorities to account. After ten years the hospital has agreed to settle out of court and now Martin tells Outlook his story. Latvia's Winners and Losers Latvia has been hit hard by the global economic crisis. It has the highest unemployment rate in the EU and only averted bankruptcy after a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. We meet the elderly Latvians who're bearing the brunt of the country's economic problems - and the people who see the recession as an opportunity... Eric Obuh Eric Obuh tells us about his double life, as a pop star and rubbish scavenger. In a moving interview he talks about what it's like to work in Lagos's largest rubbish dump. The money he makes selling other people's waste pays for his real passion in life; being a hip hop rapper called Voca Slender. Until now, neither Eric's music industry friends or his family knew about his other life on the dump. Show less
