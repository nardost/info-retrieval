One morning Naomi Jacobs woke up with a rare form of amnesia - she had lost all her adult memories, and although she was 32 - she thought she was a teenager again, utterly bewildered by how she had ended up in the future. Naomi had to rediscover the person she grew up to be, and what she found out wasn't promising.
