Climate talks typically end in disenchantment and disarray, so will this year's summit in Paris be any different? In the first of a three-part series Roger Harrabin examines the science behind climate change. Predicting the future climate is a pretty tricky business and over the last 25 years or so it has had a chequered history. Roger talks to the scientists about their models and asks if they are accurate enough or should they just be consigned to the dustbin. He takes tea with the leading US politician who simply won't be convinced of man-made climate change. He meets the 'luke-warmers' who believe in climate change but do not think the planet will warm as much as predicted. He will also examine the current predictions and how confident we should be.
