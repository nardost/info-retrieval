Astronaut Jose Hernandez Jose Hernandez tells us about his journey from a crop picking Mexican family to American astronaut. As a boy, he dreamt of space travel, and he tells us what it was like when, in August this year, that dream came true and he made his first trip on the space shuttle "Discovery". 89 Squares: Warsaw As part of our ongoing series "89 squares" we visit Bank Square in the Polish capital Warsaw. Under the communist regime the square was re-named after the Polish man who founded the Bolshevik secret police - the Cheka. He was Feliks Dzierżyński and a giant statue of him dominated the square for years. Its toppling in 1989 was a sign of the collapse of communism.
