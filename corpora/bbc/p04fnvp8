PJ Powers is one of South Africa's best known singers. She started her career during the apartheid era of the 1980s and became the first white woman to perform to an all-black audience in the Soweto township. PJ became a prominent anti-apartheid activist sharing the stage with black South African musicians and eventually singing at Nelson Mandela's inauguration. Ming Chan from Shanghai was on holiday in Mexico when he decided to go diving in a cage. During the experience he had a close call with a great white shark. Twenty-five years ago Jim Richards left his home in the UK and his job in the army to make his fortune in a gold rush in South America. He went on to chase gold and diamond rushes across the world.
