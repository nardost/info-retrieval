Jim Al-Khalili finds out about the life scientific of the British Antarctic Survey biologist Lloyd Peck. Amongst other creatures he studies giant sea spiders. They and other small animals grow far bigger than usual in the extreme cold. Diving is an important part of Lloyd's job and Jim hears what it's like to play football under the ice. Studies suggest that the sea temperature is rising, and Lloyd investigates whether the animals he researches will be able to adapt and survive. And Lloyd talks about the difficulty of leaving his family behind in the UK while he spends months in the Antarctic.
