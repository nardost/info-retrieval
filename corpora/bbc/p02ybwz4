Sergey Ananov is a Russian pilot who was attempting to become the first person to fly around the world in a light helicopter, weighing less than one tonne. But the record journey went dramatically wrong near the Arctic Circle, and he had to ditch into the ice cold sea just off Baffin Island in Canada. He was stuck on an ice floe for 36 hours and had to fight off polar bears. He told Jo Fidgen about his incredible fight for survival. Every year, the Scottish capital, Edinburgh, hosts the biggest arts festival in the world - over 50,000 performances from almost 50 countries.

By chance, she found out that one of the state's first Aids patients was being treated there. His family would not look after him, so Ruth took it upon herself to care for him even though she had no medical training. And over the years, she has done the same for nearly a thousand people - often burying them herself in her family cemetery.
