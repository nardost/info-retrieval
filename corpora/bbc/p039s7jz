Space: Personal stories that are out of this world. In 2013 Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano was performing repairs on the outside of the International Space Station with fellow astronaut Chris Cassidy. It was a typical mission until a fault in his helmet caused events to spiral out of control. We meet the heavy metal guitarist who discovered signs of liquid water on Mars. Originally from Nepal, Lujendra Ojha moved to the US when he was 16 years old. He's currently studying for a PhD in Planetary Science. Dr Ed Lu has quite a CV. As a physicist and former NASA astronaut, he's been on two shuttle missions and spent six months on the International Space Station. But he's now turned his attention to nothing less than protecting the future of the earth - specifically from the threat of asteroid strikes. Pakistan-born artist Nasser Azam is known for making paintings in the most extreme environments. He has completed projects on board a specially-modified aircraft to simulate weightless conditions and in Antarctica.
