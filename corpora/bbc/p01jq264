On Outlook with Lucy Ash, former North Korean spy Kim Dong-sik talks about the terrible price he paid when he was caught by the enemy. Also today, Congolese author Alain Mabanckou relives memories in his home city of Pointe Noir. We meet racing cyclist Alex Dowsett, the world's only top sportsman who suffers from haemophilia, and we travel to Paris to meet the ballet dancers, actors and musicians who live in an all-female retirement home with a difference.
