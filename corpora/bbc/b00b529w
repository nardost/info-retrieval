HEARING VOICES The phenomenon of hearing voices might not be as unusual as we think, and many people even live quite happily with the voices they hear. Sometimes the voices have helpful advice, or words of encouragement to offer. But where do the voices come from? Might they be the sound of society itself? Dr Julie Kirby, senior Lecturer at Edge Hill University talks about her research study of over sixty people who live with voice hearing. PAGANISM Laurie Taylor is joined by Dr Graham Harvey, Reader in Religious Studies at The Open University and the author of paper entitled Recent developments in Paganism and Professor Wendy Griffin, co-founder of the Pagan Studies Group of the American Academy of Religion, to discuss the nature of contemporary paganism and to find out if it can ever become more accepted as a religion in the future.
