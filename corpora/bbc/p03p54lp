Outlook turns 50 this year and to celebrate we're searching for inspirational stories from across the world that's why this Outlook Weekend is all about inspirational people. Hekmat Qassar and Anas Maghrebi from Syria play in a rock band called Khebez Dawle. Like thousands of other Syrian migrants they fled from their homeland and in 2015 travelled by boat to Europe. But their arrival on the beach at the Greek island of Lesbos was different from most, the musicians handed out copies of their debut album to tourists as they came ashore. 21-year-old Neetu Sarkar has never given up on her dreams. Today she's a medal winning wrestler who competes at the highest levels of her sport, but growing up in a rural part of northern India, her journey to the top has been far from straightforward. 30 year old Wayetu Moore has recently returned to Liberia on a mission to help Monrovia's children learn to read. She grew up in the country during the Civil War of the 1990s, but one morning her family were forced to flee, first the city and then to America. Sheldon Thomas runs Gangsline, an organisation which tries to educate young British gang members to leave their violent lifestyle behind. As a child though, Sheldon's life was heading in the wrong direction, growing up in London at a time when racial tensions were running high, he started started a gang when he was just 12 years old.
