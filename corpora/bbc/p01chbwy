Ghana sent just four Paralympians to the 2012 Paralympic Games in London, none of whom made it to the victory podium. After the difficulties they faced getting there, is still there still the will to work towards Rio 2016? Powerlifter Charles Narh Teye told the BBC World Service during London 2012, that his parents had rejected the doctor's suggestion that they 'put me to sleep' with an injection at birth. His team-mate and Ghana’s flag-bearer, wheelchair racer Raphael Nkegbe Botsyo, said there were those back home who still believed 'a disabled person in the family must be a grandfather's curse'. Paralympic athlete and gold medallist April Holmes travels to Ghana to meet the athletes and to find out if negative perceptions have changed since their performances in the British capital. April sees first-hand whether their achievements have had any impact on disability sport in the country, and asks if they have the desire and the backing to make it to Rio - and whether or not they will be part of a bigger team in 2016. She also asks Ghana’s minister for Youth and Sport and the Disabilities Commission what provisions are being made for the country’s Paralympic athletes.
