Blue Spring State Park in Florida is home to a famous network of underground caves. Divers from all over the world come to explore these beautiful underwater spaces. But if one of those divers gets into trouble - they need the help of Edd Sorensen. He's one of the world's top cave diving rescuers, and he's won many awards for his work. He told Matthew Bannister about the appeal of cave diving. At the Oscars ceremony in Hollywood earlier this month, there were a number of historic firsts. Chile won the gong for the best foreign-language film for the first time for the movie A Fantastic Woman. And the film's star - Daniela Vega - became the first openly transgender person to be a presenter at the ceremony. In the Chilean capital Santiago, our reporter Jane Chambers met Daniela and the film's director. This week, you may have been following the 2018 Winter Paralympics in South Korea. The competitors show that physical differences don't hold them back from events like downhill skiing, ice hockey and even curling. But they're not the only people with disabilities to be achieving excellence in South Korea. Goh Hong-seok is a balloon artist who makes huge and incredibly detailed statues. Our reporter Jason Strother went to meet him. (Photo credit Tarik Tinazay/AFP/Getty Images.) Show less
