Brothers Luke and Ryan Hart spent years trying to help their mum leave their abusive father. However, just two days after they succeeded, their father killed her and their sister. They told Outlook why those murders started a campaign for change. Ryan and Luke have since written a book called Operation Lighthouse. Jonna Jinton lives in the remote north of Sweden, with her pet dog and cow. She has a unique passion: trying to revive a traditional Scandinavian herding call known as 'kulning'. The so called ‘queen of salt,’ or Marie Diouf, is from Senegal and she’s on a mission to stop iodine deficiency in her community. Image: Ryan (L) and Luke (R) Hart Credit: Priya Dabasia Show less
