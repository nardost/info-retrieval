How far can we stretch the notion of a beautiful design? And, how fundamental is it to the world around us and our search for answers to lifeâ€™s mysteries? We delight in beauty when we find it in the design of everyday objects we craft and utilise. It is incorporated in the bodies we are born with and the ways we enhance them. And, on a cosmic scale, there is beauty in the rules which govern the universe. Bridget Kendall and guests explore the frontiers of what beauty in design can do for us.
