NATIONALITY: WOG David Oluwale was young Nigerian who had stowed away on a ship and came to England in 1949. He suffered from mental illness and ended up sleeping rough in Leeds, a confused, troublesome individual who picked up a string of convictions, mostly for disorderly conduct. In 1969 his body was found floating in the river Aire. Eighteen months later a police cadet set off a criminal investigation into his death. It emerged that two police officers had carried out a campaign of harassment and violence against him over a six month period leading up to his death, and had been spotted attacking Oluwale in an arcade on the night he died. Kester Aspden, writer and historian has just published Nationality: Wog. The Hounding of David Oluwale and discusses how Oluwale’s case stands in black history and the history of race crime. COLLEGE GIRLS Women gained access to University education during the second half of the 19th century, predictably there was resistance from many quarters. Many feared that the intellectual credibility of the great institutions would be compromised. There was also a worry that femininity itself would be undermined. But along side the feeling that educated women are a threat, and occasionally an abomination, there has always been a sense that they are erotic. Laurie Taylor is joined by Lynn Peril, author of a new book entitled College Girls: Bluestockings, Sex Kittens and Coeds (a comprehensive history of the American college girl) and Professor Carol Dyhouse, Research professor of History at the Sussex University whose research interests are in the social history of nineteenth and twentieth century Britain, focussing on gender and education. They consider family courses, sex classes, curfews and qualifications - the often surprising history of women’s further education. Show less
