In 1995, Sarah Vallance was an incredibly bright PhD student in Sydney, Australia. After suffering a traumatic brain injury, she began to struggle with the simplest tasks - like shopping, counting money, even reading her own thesis. But she managed to put her life back together - with the help of her dogs. Mauritanian engineer Mohamedou Salahi was detained on suspicion of being an Islamist extremist . He was released without charge after 14 years with a new friend, guard Steve Wood. Picture: Sarah Vallance sitting in the grass with her two dogs Credit: Courtesy of Sarah Vallance Show less
