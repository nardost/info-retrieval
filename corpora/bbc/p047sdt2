Two years ago, in the midst of near-constant bombardment and shortages of food, water and power, a mural appeared on the wall of a bombed out building in the Syrian city of Darayya. It was the first of many such street paintings, and the man who made them is a fighter with the Free Syrian Army. He would paint the murals in secret at night. Last month, Darayya was taken over by government forces. The artist and his comrades were evacuated to the city of Idlib. From there, he tells Matthew Bannister why his art raises morale even when people are starving and living under fire. Sunday the pig - how a three week old pig turned the life of an Australian family upside down. Owen Lowery - the former British Judo champion was only a teenager when he suffered a spinal injury which left him paralysed from the neck down. Owen's response was to turn to poetry. He took a PhD in literature and is now a published poet. In 2013 he married his long term girlfriend, who is also his full time carer. The BBC's Hilary Dunn spoke to Owen and his wife Jayne. Balbir Singh Seechewal - who also goes by the name "Eco Baba" - has dedicated his life to improving the environment in Punjab. His latest project was cleaning up 100 miles of river.
