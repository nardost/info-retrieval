Ayik Chut first met Anyang Reng in a prison camp run by children on the border of what is now South Sudan. Both were child soldiers in the 1980s in Sudan's civil war. The younger of them, Ayik Chut, was just 13 when he took up arms and was harshly punished by Anyang while in prison. Eventually each of the men ended up in Australia where, by chance, they met again. Up in the highest mountains of Bhutan there's an underground fungus that's very rare and very valuable. Cordyceps are a group of parasitic fungi that mainly grow on the bodies of insects. Some of them are worth twice their weight in gold because in China and Tibet they are considered to have medicinal properties. Not everyone going foraging is doing so legally, but Outlook's Candida Beveridge has been to meet someone who is above board. In the valleys around the city of Genoa in north Italy, there is a herd of cattle that has been making the headlines. The cows ran away from their owner and since have been dubbed the Rebel Cows. Local scientist and documentary maker Alessandro Ghiggi has been following the Rebel Cows deep into the woods to find out how they got there. (Picture: Ayik Chut and Anyang Reng.
