To his followers Lenny Bruce was a genius and a free speech hero. To his detractors he was labelled sick and dirty. Bruce shocked his audiences intentionally. In his uncompromisingly frank humour he took on organized religion, government, jingoism, capitalism, the death penalty, war, and sexual mores. But he was eventually destroyed by the battle he fought with the US justice system. The comedian, Ray Peacock nominates Lenny Bruce as his great life as he regards him as a pioneer in stand-up. Along with expert Dr Oliver Double and presenter Matthew Parris they uncover a controversial life. To illustrate the life of Lenny Bruce this programme does play some audio which some listeners may find offensive. The producer is Perminder Khatkar. Show less
