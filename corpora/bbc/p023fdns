Eric Brocklebank has had three close encounters with lightning - he tells us about the moment he was struck. Kim Ok Ja is a 76-year-old 'sea woman' from South Korea. She has been diving in the waters off Jeju Island all her life. It is traditional for women, not men, to be the breadwinners on Jeju - and Mrs Kim dives to depths of up to 10 metres without equipment in her search for sea delicacies. Roz Chast is an American cartoonist whose new book takes on a very personal subject. Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant? is about her relationship with her ageing parents. Nicki Paxman asks Roz how hard it was to turn this intimate experience into a graphic novel. Adam Warwick is an American biologist who saved a black bear from drowning, after it had wandered into the sea after being hit by a tranquiliser dart. Rapelang Rabana is one of Africa's top tech-entrepreneurs. She's from Botswana and now works in South Africa. But she says she wasn't exactly burning with ambition as a teenager.
