Personal stories behind the news from all over the world. With Matthew Bannister. A Song for Jenny; Children's Footballing World Cup "A Song for Jenny" It's five years since suicide bombers caused a series of explosions which ripped through London's transport system. Among the dead was 24 year old Jenny Nicholson. Jenny's mother Julie was an Anglican Priest based in Bristol in the West of England. Five years on, she's written a book called "Song for Jenny" in which she recalls the events of that day, and catalogues her grief and her subsequent struggle with her faith. 'A Song For Jenny', by Julie Nicholson published by Harper Collins. Children's World Cup While the Football World cup draws to a close in South Africa, the Munsieville International Children's Cup is also taking place in a township near Johannesburg. It also involves 32 national teams, but here the players are local children. The competition's been organised by the health charity Project Hope UK, which aims to help the estimated fifteen-thousand orphans and other vulnerable children in Munsieville. Matthew speaks to its organiser, former professional footballer Gift Rampuru and his daughter Neo. Show less
