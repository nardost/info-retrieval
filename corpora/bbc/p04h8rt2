Divya Arya meets the women from rural parts of India who are bucking the trend and working in jobs traditionally done by men. In Rajasthan she drops in at the Barefoot College to meet 'Solar Mamas' learning solar engineering to take electricity to their remote villages. Divya also speaks to a widowed railway porter who left her village to take on the tough job her husband used to do, meets the women in rural Karnataka finding a voice in local radio, and in Kerala speaks to those learning the traditionally male-dominated trades of boat building, masonry, carpentry and farm management.
