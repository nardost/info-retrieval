Indian police officer Ajay Pal Lamba spent years chasing after the spiritual guru Asaram Bapu. The world famous demigod was accused of raping a 16 year old. Despite threats to his life from the guru's supporters, Ajay never gave up and tells Outlook's Emily Webb how he brought Asaram Bapu to justice. Outlook Inspirations nominee Seyi Oluyole is transforming disadvantaged young lives in Nigeria through her dance group 'Dream Catchers'. It's made up of children from one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Lagos. To join Dream Catchers, the children make a deal - they agree to go to school and stick with their studies. If you're not learning - you're not dancing. Her work and the children's moves have caught the attention of some big names like Rihanna and Naomi Campbell after Seyi posted videos of the children dancing online. Seyi Oluyole appeared on Outlook April 2018.
