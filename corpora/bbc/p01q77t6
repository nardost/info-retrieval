Fatima Khan spent six months in Syria campaigning for the release of her son Abbas - a British doctor who had entered the county without a visa and was arrested. On the day he was to be released she was told that he had died in prison. Fifty years after graduating from art school Michael Chow has rediscovered his love of art. Best known as the owner of the Mr Chow restaurants, an exhibition of his paintings has just opened in Hong Kong under his Chinese name Zhou Yinghua and the fitting title "Recipe for a Painter". Mpho Lakaje meets Khanyisile Motsa - the South African woman rescuing teenage prostitutes in Johannesburg. She has rescued dozens of girls from the streets and local brothels since she established the Home of Hope more than a decade ago. And the story of Namgel, the Sherpa who saved the lives of watchmaker/owner Michael Kobold and his wife whilst climbing Everest. Show less
