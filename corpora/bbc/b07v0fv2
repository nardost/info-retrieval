Eliza Carthy chooses the life of nineteenth-century poet and campaigner Caroline Norton to discuss with Matthew Parris. Following separation from her controlling husband, Norton fought to gain access to her three children. She campaigned for thirty years resulting in changes to English Law that gave women a separate legal identity for the first time. Eliza first discovered Caroline Norton when she was researching broadside ballads and came across Norton's verse ' Love not! love not! ye hopeless sons of clay'. It stood out, becoming the inspiration for her track 'Fade and Fall' and sparking an interest in Norton and her extraordinary life. The expert is Dr Diane Atkinson, author of 'The Criminal Conversation of Mrs Norton'. Producer: Toby Field. Show less
