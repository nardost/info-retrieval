Link: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01n3bbm
Last Broadcast Date: Wed 18 Dec 2013
Starlady Nungari is a flamboyant transgender hairdresser who brings colour into the lives of young Aboriginal people in the Australian outback. Plus, the rat catcher of New York Richard Reynolds and a group of fellow dog owners have been hunting for rats in the darkest alleyways of Manhattan for the past 10 years. Matt Nelson joined them on one of their expeditions. Desmond Morris has been a painter for as long as he has been a scientist. He is also a legendary writer and broadcaster. He talks about his passions for all things human. And, Shahed Kayes brings floating schools to the deprived and isolated river gypsies, or Bede people, who live on the River Meghna in Bangladesh.
