Fathers are often regarded as secondary parents in many cultures, perhaps even more so when they have girls. We examine why this can be damaging, and the ways in which fathers can have a profound influence on how their daughters navigate the world. Evolutionary anthropologist Dr Anna Machin explains why human fathers are in the only five per cent of mammals that stick around after the birth of their offspring, and why that’s important, particularly for girls. Father and daughter team Jerry and Chloe Hughes, who run a fine art foundry, talk about how working together has changed their family dynamic for the better. We also look at the consequences of a dysfunctional father-daughter relationship. Professor of Adolescent and Educational Psychology Dr Linda Nielsen describes how a poor relationship with a father affects a daughter’s life choices well into adulthood. Writer and podcaster Carvell Wallace gives some sage parenting advice to fathers of teenage girls, and we hear from Australian dad Jonathan Poyter, who took part in a 13-week programme called DADEE at Newcastle University in Australia, where dads and daughters learn to bond through sports. And it’s not just a one way street. Dr Joan Costa-Font, professor in the Department of Health Policy at the London School of Economics, tells us about his latest research, which shows that daughters also have a big impact on the behaviour of their fathers.
