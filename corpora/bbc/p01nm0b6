Colonel Chris Hadfield has spent decades training as an astronaut and has logged nearly 4,000 hours in Space. During this time he has broken into a Space Station with a Swiss army knife, been confronted by a live snake while piloting a plane, been temporarily blinded while clinging to the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft, and became a YouTube sensation with his performance of David Bowie's Space Oddity in space. The secret to Chris Hadfield's success and survival is an unconventional philosophy he learned at NASA - prepare for the worst, and enjoy every moment of it. Read by Garrick Hagon. Show less
