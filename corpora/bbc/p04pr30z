British mountaineer and former soldier Leslie Binns was just 400 metres from achieving his lifelong dream of reaching the summit of Everest, when he came across an Indian climber who was in real danger. Sunita Hazra was running out of oxygen and would have died if it were not for Leslie who helped her back down the mountain. They tell Jo Fidgen about their extraordinary experience. In the middle of a forest in Italy, there is an amusement park like no other. It runs without electricity, and it costs nothing to enjoy the rides. And, for Bruno Ferrin, the man who dreamt it up and built it - it has been a life-changing experience. Outlook reporter Alessia Cerantola has been to meet him. Carole Bayer Sager is an award-winning American songwriter and her hundreds of songs have been performed by people like Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson and Aretha Franklin. She co-wrote some of the songs with Burt Bacharach, who she was married to for 10 years. Carole's memoir is called They're Playing Our Song, and she tells Outlook's Tim Allen about her life.
