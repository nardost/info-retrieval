New Orleans Superdome It's hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico and almost five years since Hurricane Katrina wreaked devastation on the lives of Louisianans, the people of New Orleans are still clearing up. At the end of August 2005, 1800 people died when the city's flood defences - or levees - collapsed and water cascaded through the streets and into houses. Many residents fled from the fury of the oncoming storm and even now, a third of the city's population has not returned. But at the height of the tumult, for the elderly, poor and ill, the city's central sports stadium became the place of refuge - they were among the many thousands of people who could not leave the city. We've been to New Orleans to hear the story of that iconic building which, five years ago, was at the heart of the drama - the Super Dome. Show less
