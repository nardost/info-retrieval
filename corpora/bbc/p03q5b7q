Bashir Ahmad is a Pakistani American former soldier who took up martial arts in his spare time. He has now become a cage fighting star in Pakistan, and is using his martial arts skills to train street kids. The self-taught conductor Hekima Raymond has revived the Dar-es-Salaam Choral Society and Orchestra with the aim of putting classical music at the heart of Tanzanian life. In a city with no concert hall, he has made it his life's mission to champion Western classical music. Yuval Roth is an Israeli man whose brother was killed by Hamas. Instead of seeking revenge, Yuval decided to help the Palestinian communities where his brother's killers came from and set up a team of volunteers to transport sick Palestinans to Israeli hospitals. Jack Cooke is an English man who has swapped his suit and office job for a life exploring the world from the tops of trees. He is determined to get other people to share his passion, and spend more time climbing trees. (Photo: Bashir Ahmad. Photo: Credit One Championship.) Show less
