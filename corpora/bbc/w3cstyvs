How do you teach someone empathy? Dr Fatima Akilu has an extraordinary insight into why people do violent things because she's been the therapist for some notorious individuals and members of extremist organisations. Fatima comes from northern Nigeria and she has been working to deradicalise former supporters of Boko Haram. Rodrigo Medellin is fascinated by bats. As mammals go, bats don't do well in the popularity stakes, but they have a good side, as pollinators and producers of fertiliser. Rodrigo has been studying them for years and Outlook's Clayton Conn went with him on a research mission in a spectacular location. Mokhtar Alkhanshali grew up in San Francisco, but comes from a family of coffee farmers in Yemen. He visited his family in the holidays and helped pick the coffee cherries. He had always planned to follow a career in law but he gave up his studies to start a coffee import business. La Musica del Pacifico tells the story of west coast Colombians, and celebrates their diverse cultural mix. Nidia Gongora is from the Pacific coast of Colmbia and she is on a mission to keep the traditional music alive and share it with the rest of the world. (Picture courtesy of Dr Fatima Akilu.) Show less
