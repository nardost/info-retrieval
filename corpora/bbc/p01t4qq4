Norwegian-Somali singer Mohamed Abdi Farah on recovering after the Utoya massacre and his hopes of representing Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest. Nguyen Van Dung is a peach tree farmer whose orchard runs along the banks of the Red River in Hanoi. When the river floods, bodies often wash up, and over the years Dung has pulled dozens of corpses from the river and he's created his own graveyard to honour the dead. Briton Jamie McDonald has spent the past year running across Canada - from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific - 8,000 km, the equivalent of 200 marathons. He's now completed his journey and shares his tale with his father, Donald. American actor George Takei, best known for his role as Star Trek's Mr Sulu, shares his childhood story of internment which inspired the musical Allegiance. And Keralan artist Ani Varnam on why he decided to paint with his tongue - and his nose and his toes.
