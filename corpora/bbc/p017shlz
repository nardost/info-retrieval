Episode 2/6. Shaimaa Khalil examines the challenges facing her country two years after the Egyptian revolution. Under former President Mubarak there was a strong tradition of diverse but restricted media in Egypt. Post revolution, the restrictions have been lifted, allowing new voices to be heard from across the political spectrum. Political satirist Bassem Youssef invites Shaimaa to watch his hugely popular TV show where he cracks jokes about Egyptian politicians and even targets its President, Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. She also visits a hardline Salafi TV station where the output is very different and where any criticism of religion or religious leaders is considered unacceptable. All challenges for Egypt's new democracy. Produced by Daniel Tetlow. (Image of political satirist Bassem Youssef's show in the Cairo Cinema Radio Theatre. BBC Copyright) Show less
