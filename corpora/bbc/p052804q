Duke Schneider is a former wrestler from New York. He is also a former neo-Nazi. For eight years he was a devoted member of the movement. Then he realised he was falling in love with a woman who, according to his Nazi principles, he should hate - an African American health worker called Catherine Boone. Duke and Catherine tell Jo Fidgen their extraordinary story. In Baghdad it is unusual to see a woman riding a bike so Marina Jaber stands out when she cycles around town. Not everyone approves, but she is not going to let that stop her. She tells us how she's got people used to the idea of women cyclists. In 1994 Ghanaian musician, Ata Kak released his first record. It sold only a handful of copies and Ata Kak retired from music, a disappointed man. Then in 2002 an American student called Brian Shimkovitz stopped at a stall selling cassette tapes in Cape Coast in Ghana and made a chance discovery. Juliana Kasumu has complex feelings about hair.
