Bryan Stevenson grew up in a poor community in the racially segregated state of Delaware. Twenty-five years ago, he founded the Equal Justice Initiative, a legal practice dedicated to defending the poor, the wrongly condemned, and those trapped by the American criminal justice system. Archbishop Desmond Tutu has compared him to the young Nelson Mandela - who was also a lawyer fighting for truth and justice. Playwright Shahid Nadeem talks about his play Dara - based on the bitter power struggles of India's Mughal Empire. He also reflects on a lifetime of writing and campaigning about injustices in Pakistan, tackling themes from blasphemy laws to the rights and wrongs of wearing the burqa. British journalist Ann Morgan explains why she read a book from every country in the world in just a year. And, on losing a beloved parent to Ebola - journalist Syerramia Willoughby pays tribute to her father, Victor Robertson Willoughby who was a leading doctor in Sierra Leone. (Photo: Bryan Stevenson.
