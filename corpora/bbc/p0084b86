On Outlook today with Lucy Ash... Ayaan Hirsi Ali Some people think she is heroic - others call her a heretic. We talk to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the Somali born woman who attacked Islam and now lives under armed guard in the USA. She tells us how makes no apology for her provocative views and says she has no regrets. She tells us of her journey from her Somali family to her new home in Washington USA where she works for a right wing think tank. Saving Keta From The Sea And we visit the sleepy fishing town of Keta in Ghana, where over the last century the ocean has ripped one kilometre of coastline from the shores. Keta is now only one fifth of the size it was a hundred years ago. We talk to civil engineer Rex Edeka whose own classroom was regularly flooded. He says he remembers fishing for tilapia beneath his desk. Forty years later he's responsible for the largest coastal engineering project the region has ever seen. Show less
