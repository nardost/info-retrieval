It's 25 years since the 1988 uprising in Burma - the protest that saw thousands killed and imprisoned followed by years of military dictatorship. But as Burma opens up, the country is changing. New Year, New Burma follows Thagyamin Burma's water festival god, as he makes his annual four-day visit to Earth to check out how its people are doing. Armed with two books, his job is to write their deeds down in his 'good' and 'bad' books. This year, as the country undergoes transition, he'll be judging how well Burma's people are using their new-found freedoms. One new freedom comes in the form of thangyat - the satirical art form, newly legalised after two decades of being banned. Traditionally chanted on stages across the country during the water festival, thangyats are playful skits, criticising politicians and anyone else they think deserves it. Taking centre stage is 22-year-old student activist Aint Thiri Thu. Our water god follows Thiri as she prepares to tell the government just what she and her student friends think. They are worried about education, about power shortages and about corruption, but are they brave enough to voice their deepest criticisms? Across other water festival stages are the voices of thangyat troops, poking fun at and satirising the past year's mistakes. But can they revive an art form they've never even heard? And how effective can it be? Will the former government, not used to admitting mistakes, listen to the voice of the people? And if so, will those who make their voices heard be safe?
