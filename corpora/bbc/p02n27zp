Four farmers from four continents discuss the pleasures and challenges presented by the rural lives that they have chosen. James Rebanks and his family have shepherded in the Lake District for generations. He has 500 Herdwick sheep and over 30,000 Twitter followers. Jo Fidgen spent a day herding sheep with him and his dog. Sandy Martin and his wife Di own a sheep station in South Australia. One of the busiest times of year is when their 15,000 sheep are shorn of their thick coats. Sandy showed Lauren Waldhuter around his farm and inside his shearing shed. Aftab Ahmad lost thousands of chickens to disease on his farm just outside Delhi where his crops now include wheat and mustard. Suhail Haleem went to meet him. American Trey Lewis has a buffalo farm near Baltimore County, Maryland. Jane O'Brien braved a blizzard to see how his herd was coping with the weather. Rob Ferguson also farms buffalo near Washington DC. He joined the others for the discussion as Trey was stuck in the Maryland snow. (Photo: Herdwick sheep on a Cumbrian hill.
