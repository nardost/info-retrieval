Dr Joseph Sonnabend is a retired doctor who has had an important role to play in the history of HIV/AIDS. He saw some of the earliest patients in New York in the days before anyone even knew what the condition was. And he invested a huge amount in helping them deal with their illness and the stigma. Joseph is also a musical composer and his music is being performed in public for the first time this week at an HIV/AIDS awareness festival in London. Zumba is an exercise fitness programme set to Latin music, with choreographed songs that put the emphasis on having fun while burning calories. It's taught in more than 180 countries and there is even a new Guinness World Record for the largest Zumba class, set last month by a group of 13,350 people in the Philippines. The man who created it more than 30 years ago is Colombian Alberto Perez or 'Beto' for short. With the help of Alberto Perlman and Alberto Aghion, it has become a huge business, and Beto still travels the world teaching it. Outlook's Dany Mitzman caught up with him in Italy. About a year ago, Adriane Ohanesian experienced the most terrifying day of her life. She has covered many conflicts as a war photographer. But on this trip she was in a wildlife park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Okapi National Park. She and a couple of other journalists were spending some time with the park's rangers, whose job is to protect the giraffe-like okapi that live there, and protect people from the militias who want to get hold of the various resources in the park. But one day, they ran into a great deal of trouble. Image and credit: Dr Joseph Sonnabend Show less
