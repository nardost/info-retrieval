Meg and Elena were living oceans apart in Canada and Russia when they met in an online chatroom. Elena's family in Russia couldn't accept that she was in love with a woman so the couple came up with a daring escape plan. They decided to sail tens of thousands of kilometres from Turkey to Canada, even though they didn't have the skills or experience for such a challenge.
