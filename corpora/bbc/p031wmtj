The Norwegian summer camp on the island of Utoya where gunman Anders Behring Breivik murdered 69 people, re-opened this year for the first time since the killings. We hear from Rustam Daudov who was at the camp when Breivik began his attack in July 2011. Although Rustam was only sixteen at the time, he was able to save twenty-three people by hiding them in a cave. He tells Matthew Bannister what happened. In 2011, British doctor Andrew Bastawrous travelled to Kenya to find out why so many people there were going blind. He realised that because Kenya's few eye specialists worked mainly in urban areas, curable eye conditions were going untreated in millions of people. So he came up with a way of turning an ordinary smart phone into a high tech retina scanner. The technology - known as PEEK - means people in remote areas can now have their eyes examined by a specialist working hundreds of miles away. Andrew and Kenyan eye specialist Dr Hillary Rono came into the Outlook studio to explain how PEEK works. Daniel Cabrera is a nine-year-old boy who lives in the city of Cebu in the Philippines. One evening in June, a passer by took a photo of Daniel doing his homework on the pavement by the light of a fast food restaurant. The photo went viral on social media and donations and scholarships began to pour in from people touched by his dedication. For Outlook, reporter Aurora Almendral went to visit Daniel and his mum Christina to find out how their lives have changed. The writer and illustrator Malik Sajad grew up in Kashmir. Since he was thirteen, Malik has published cartoons satirising the political situation there. Now he's written a graphic novel called Munnu, A Boy From Kashmir which vividly portrays his difficult childhood in Indian-administered Kashmir. (Photo: Gorm Kallestad/AFP/Getty Images) Show less
