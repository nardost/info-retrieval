Margaret Boemer from the United States was 16 weeks pregnant when she went for a routine scan and realised that something wasn't right. Doctors found a huge tumour on her unborn child. Margaret was facing losing her daughter when she was told that doctors could perform fetal surgery - which would involve delivering the baby, operating, and putting her back in the womb. We hear from Margaret and from Dr Oluyinka Olutoye, the Nigerian doctor who performed the surgery. For the past decade, Kledi Kadiu has been one of the faces of "Amici" - a famous Italian reality dance show. Before the glamour though, Kledi was a refugee who fled Albania as a teenager. He tells us about his extraordinary journey and why his passion for dance has been with him all the way. Tucked away on a street corner in the Fitzrovia district of central London is a museum which houses a nostalgic collection of childhood toys, in particular a collection of toy theatres - most of them dating back to the late 19th Century. The man behind the museum is Eddy Fawdry. Emily Webb went to meet him and find out more. (Picture: Jeff and Margaret Boemer with their daughter Lynlee Hope and Dr Oluyinka Olutoye.
