When Tom Patterson caught a superbug infection in 2015, he thought his life was over. The antibiotics had stopped working, he was in a coma and doctors had given up hope. But his wife - scientist Steffanie Strathdee - went on an international medical quest to save him. Tom and Steffanie have written a book about their experience - 'The Perfect Predator: A scientist's race to save her husband from a deadly superbug'. Isabel and Susana González hunt percebes, also known as gooseneck barnacles. They're rather ugly crustaceans that can fetch thousands of dollars per kilogram at auction. To collect them, the González sisters must traverse slippery rocks along the Spanish coastline where they risk falling and drowning. But they also faced death threats when they stood up to patriarchy in their industry. Outlook's Pablo Esparza Altuna went to meet them.
