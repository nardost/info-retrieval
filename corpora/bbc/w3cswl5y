Charles Morse was a US soldier who served in the American Samoa in 1942. While he was there, he fell in love with a woman called Eppe. She was the daughter of the village chief – and they were not given permission to marry. Seventy years later, Charles’ relatives uncovered the story of their love. Mariela Shaker is a Syrian refugee whose violin became her saviour, even when it seemed the war would put an end to her dreams of playing music. Image: Charles Morse Credit: The Morse Family Show less
