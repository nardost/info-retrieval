Germaine Greer delivers a talk questioning the pursuit of freedom at BBC Radio 3's Free Thinking Festival 2011. One of the most influential intellectual voices of our times, Germaine Greer has caused controversy ever since her book The Female Eunuch became an international best-seller in 1970. Inspired by the Janis Joplin lyric "Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose", she argues that the pursuit of freedom has caused havoc throughout the world, and calls for a new version of liberation. Night Waves presenter Philip Dodd hosts Germaine Greer's talk, which was recorded in front of an audience at BBC Radio 3's Free Thinking Festival 2011. Free Thinking takes place at The Sage Gateshead 4 - 6 November and is broadcast on Radio 3 for three weeks following Friday 4 November. Show less
