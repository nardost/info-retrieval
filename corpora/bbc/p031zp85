Ugandan vet Peter Apell has dedicated his life to saving chimpanzees. He treks into remote forests - often climbing trees to rescue his patients and then performing surgery on the spot. Peter works for The Jane Goodall Institute - an organisation dedicated to the protection of Great Apes. He tells Matthew Bannister about his extraordinary job. The young Chinese pianist Yuja Wang has taken classical music by storm, not only with her dynamic playing but also with her daring outfits on stage. The 28-year-old has recently been appearing at the world's largest classical music festival, the BBC Proms in London. Andrea Kidd went to meet her. Reports of a Yeti have been recorded for centuries in the Himalayas. In the villages of central Bhutan locals still tell each other stories of seeing footprints from the mythical beast while out tending their animals on the mountain passes. Reporter Candida Beveridge has been to the village of Chendebji to investigate. 30-year-old Karim Traor√© fled the civil war in his native Ivory Coast at the age of 19. He's spent the last decade on the move across North Africa. But time and time again he's been saved by his tailoring skills. Now he's started a new life in Tunisia, making bags for tourists from recycled coffee sacks. (Picture: Peter Apell of the Jane Goodall Institute) Show less
