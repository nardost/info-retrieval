CITIES AND ETHNICITIES Last week Laurie Taylor travelled to Marseille to find out how the city’s ethnic diversity helped it to escape the race riots that scarred much of the rest of France. Can lessons be learnt from France’s most diverse city? And how successful is the British model of multi-culturalism? Laurie Taylor is joined by four experts on ethnic diversity, Professor Tariq Modood, Professor Sophie Watson, Professor Lola Young (Baroness Young of Hornsey) and Ted Cantle to discuss race, immigration and ethnicity in our cities and to debate the relative merits of multicultural and assimilatory approaches to migrant cultures.
