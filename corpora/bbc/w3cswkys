Rolf Sorman was one of the survivors of the Estonia ferry disaster 24 years ago. The ferry that sank in the Baltic Sea while sailing from Tallinn to Stockholm, where Rolf is from. He tells Jo Fidgen about his dramatic survival. Back in 2004 four American students hatched an elaborate scheme to steal some of the worldâ€™s rarest and most valuable books. Pretty much everything that could go wrong did... and what started out as a criminal caper ended up changing their lives forever. Outlook's Saskia Edwards spoke to them. (Picture: Rolf Sorman.
