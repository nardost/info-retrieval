Brian Eno has worked with David Bowie, David Byrne and U2 but his choice of Great Life is not a rock star but the sociologist Lord Young of Dartington. Michael Young wrote the Labour party's 1945 election manifesto, researched slum clearance in the East End of London, set up the Consumers' Association, coined the word meritocracy, co-founded the Open University and planned the colonisation of Mars. With the help of Michael's son Toby, Brian considers the life and work of one of the architects of post-war Britain. Producer: Julia Johnson. Show less
