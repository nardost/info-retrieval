Sole Mio are tenor brothers Pene and Amitai Pati, and their cousin, the baritone Moses Mackay. They came together three years ago as a threesome to raise funds for their international vocal studies. Their debut album, also called O Sole Mio, was the biggest selling album last year in New Zealand.

He describes the survivor's guilt he has felt since then and why he has found it helpful to meet other sole survivors around the world. Carolina Cabezas talks about bringing up a baby in one of the coldest places on earth - Antarctica. Pati Ruiz is one of Latin America's most respected environmentalists.
