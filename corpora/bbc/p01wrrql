The fate of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 may never be known. It seems most likely that it crashed into the Indian Ocean with the loss of everyone on board. In The Mystery of Flight 370, Melanie Abbott asks how an aeroplane can go missing in the 21st Century and why, nearly a month after it disappeared, we are apparently no nearer to solving the mystery of what happened to it.
