World renowned DJ Edu, aka The ‘Afro Boss’, is on a journey across Africa to explore how the young generation are having fun from Friday to Sunday. This show is part of the BBC’s ‘A Richer World’ season looking at how many people across the world are getting richer. And when a place starts to become prosperous, what could be better than dancing the night away in some of the world’s best up and coming nightclubs? He starts in his hometown Nairobi and finds out how young, up and coming DJs, are making their mark on the music world by selling mixtapes on the public buses. In Morocco he finds a new music genre called Afro-bian and in Botswana, an emerging outdoor festival culture is pushing back against government attempts to crackdown on anti-social behaviour. Moving to Central Africa and The Democratic Republic of Congo, DJ Edu meets the new generation of Sapeurs – Kinshasa’s gentleman dandies, now made famous by ad agencies around the world. He finishes in South Africa, whose native house music scene is taking the clubbing world by storm, and discovers a hipster’s paradise in Johannesburg, which has reformed a previously ‘no-go’ area to the ‘must-go’ area. Not only will Edu find out what makes each scene special, he also delves into the neighbourhoods around them, finding out more about local people, their history, their food markets, what makes them tick and what makes them dance until dawn.
