Chess is an ancient game that has been widely popular for centuries â€“ but how is it faring in modern times? Simon Terrington, a self-confessed chess fanatic, explores the game in today's world. Is modern technology changing it and how it's played? In a world where there are more and more calls upon our time, do people still wish to devote hours to mastering it? Simon reaffirms his love for chess by absorbing the passion it generates, from grandmasters to community club players; from the World Chess Championship to the chess boards of a Bulgarian park. These programmes build a new picture of a game: a game with a wealth of beneficial attributes, but also one with a pugilistic, addictive hook that keeps players coming back to the board, again and again. In part one, Simon assesses how computer technology has affected the game at the highest level and what this means for its future. He looks at the moment when chess champion Garry Kasparov was beaten by the IBM computer Deep Blue and hears from experts about the impact that event had across the game. Show less
