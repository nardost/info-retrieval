Artyom Yaroshevich is an opera singer from Ukraine who is still performing every week in the war-torn city of Donetsk. He says he believes the conflict has given his job new significance. Karim Miske has just written an award-winning debut novel in France. It tells the story of a young mixed-race man called Ahmed, who is investigating the murder of his upstairs neighbour. The book is called Arab Jazz. The Nepalese royal family used to have a taste for expensive cars. The only trouble was getting them to their palace in Kathmandu. There were not any roads - so an ingenious solution was devised - the cars would be carried by porters, on their shoulders, across mountains. Ninety-two-year-old Dhan Gole is believed to be the last surviving car porter of Nepal. For nearly 30 years, Mark Landis donated scores of artworks by famous artists to museums all over the US. He was feted as a philanthropist. But all of them were forged - by Mark himself. Because he never took any money from the museums, he has not committed a crime under US law. We talk to Mark and the man who uncovered the forgeries, Matt Leininger. (Picture: Artyom Yaroshevich, right. Credit: AP Photo/Petr David Josek) Show less
