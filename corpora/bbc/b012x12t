On Last Word this week: The Reverend John Stott, whose influential books and sermons earned him the unofficial moniker of "the Protestant's Pope." Fran Landesman, jazz lyricist, poet, bohemian whose wild life made her at least as famous as did her art. Author, Stan Barlow, one of the so-called Angry Young Men who brought the working class north to literary life in A Kind of Loving. Professor Derek Bryce-Smith, whose work played a key role in the introduction of unleaded petrol. And David Dunseith, police officer turned broadcaster who described his phone-in programme on Radio Ulster as a "people's parliament" during the troubles. Show less
