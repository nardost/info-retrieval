Last Broadcast Date: Wed 2 Oct 2013
We hear the story of one Mauritanian man's extraordinary journey to freedom as he escaped from decades of slavery. He talks about his efforts to find his family in the desert and free his sister and her children. Also we meet Roz Savage, the woman who rowed solo across three oceans. She spoke to Matthew Bannister about giving up her career and her marriage, selling her possessions and setting off to row solo across the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. She has rowed more than 15,000 miles and spent cumulatively more than 500 days of her life at sea. Journalist Barb Stegemann took an interest in Afghanistan after a friend was badly injured there whilst serving in the Canadian military. She started a company that makes perfumes from rose oil and orange blossom grown in Afghanistan to divert people away from producing poppies for opium. And the urban explorer Bradley Garret reveals some of London's subterranean secrets as he talks about the people who set out to access parts of the world's cities rarely seen by their everyday inhabitants.
