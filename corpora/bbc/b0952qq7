Constance Markievicz led an amazing life - a leading figure during the Easter Rising of 1916, she was the first woman elected to Westminster though she never took her seat. Markievicz was born into a wealthy anglo-Irish family and gained her exotic surname from marriage to a Polish count. She was adventurous, flamboyant, committed to woman's rights, court-martialled and nearly shot. Nominating her is Andrea Catherwood, ex-ITN correspondent who made her first documentary for Radio 4. Alongside her in the studio is Lindie Naughton, author of Markievicz - A Most Outrageous Rebel. Matthew Parris presents, the producer in Bristol is Miles Warde. Show less
