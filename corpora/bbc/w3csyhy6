In 1973 Mexican anthropologist Santiago Genov√©s decided to create an experiment to find out what drives people to commit acts of violence. He put a group of men and women from different parts of the world on a raft and cast them out to sea. What happened was not what he expected though, as we hear from three of the women who took part - Fay Seymour, Edna Reves and Maria Bjornstam. Ana Fidelia Quirot has a pretty amazing nickname: people call her the 'Storm of the Caribbean'. That's because she's one of the five fastest women in the world over 800 metres. She's a two-time world champion who's also pocketed two Olympic medals. But she also has an incredible story of triumph over tragedy when she overcame bad burn injuries after an accident in 1993. Outlook's Jane Chambers travelled to Ana's home in Havana to meet her. Beat Wampfler is a cheesemaker from Switzerland whose techniques have attracted some attention. In a world of traditional cheese production, he's been trying to find out whether cheese enjoys music. (Photo credit: Modern Films.) Show less
