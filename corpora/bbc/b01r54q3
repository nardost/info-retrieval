Last Broadcast Date: Mon 11 Mar 2013
On Start the Week Jonathan Freedland talks to Ken Loach about post-war Britain, and the spirit of unity which aimed to create a vision of a fairer society. Thirty years on and this culture of cooperation descended into fist fights in the House of Commons, and James Graham's stage imagining of the 1974 hung parliament. David Boyle takes the story on to examine the demise of the middle classes, and Harriet Sergeant looks at Britain's underclass, and the reasons why it's growing. Producer: Katy Hickman. Show less
