US athlete and Olympic champion Michael Johnson is one of the greatest sprinters in history. In the 1990s, he tore through the record books with a series of thrilling gold medal wins. Even after he retired from racing, he kept up a rigorous work-out regime, exuding health and fitness. So, for Michael it was frightening and unnerving when he had a stroke in 2018. It left him unable to move by himself and he had no idea if heâ€™d ever recover. Michael Johnson was once the fastest man in the world - would he learn to walk again?
