Andrew Marr talks to the sculptor Anthony Caro about the development of modern British sculpture. Caro once worked out of a small garage at home, creating his growing metal structures, and it's the artist's studio that interests the art critic, Michael Peppiatt. He's attempting to capture the unique atmosphere of the tiny ramshackle studio behind Montparnasse where Alberto Giacometti lived and worked for nearly 40 years. For the last decade Sir Mark Jones has worked out of one of the grandest buildings in London, the Victoria and Albert Museum. As he prepares to step down next year, he talks about the continuing relevance of a museum that showcases objects and design. While the V+A has regularly exhibited works of fashion, several haute couture shops now pretend to be art galleries, and the writer, Justine Picardie asks how far fashion can be considered art.
