Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, US athlete Marlon Shirley, the original blade runner. He was the first man to gain the title of "the world's fastest amputee" after he broke the 11 seconds mark for running 100 metres. He won gold at the Sydney and Athens Paralympic Games and he also won medals for the long and the high jump. But Marlon had an exceptionally tough start. He begged for food on the streets of Las Vegas before he was taken into an orphanage at the age of five. It was there that he lost his foot in a lawnmower accident. Marlon was eventually successfully adopted, and his athletic potential was spotted at an inter-state high school athletics competition. He went on to become one of the greatest Paralympians. Show less
