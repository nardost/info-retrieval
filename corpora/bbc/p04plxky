Tom Marcus - not his real name - was a spy, an undercover agent for the British security agency, MI5. A few years ago he spent several months pretending to be a homeless man living on the streets of north London. He went to great lengths to blend in, but it was all worth it when he ended up preventing two coaches full of school children from being blown up. He's written a book about his experience which is called "Soldier Spy". The sport of sumo wrestling has a huge following in Japan ... but it's also growing in popularity in Brazil, which has the largest Japanese population outside the country. Luciana Watanabe has Japanese heritage - and a passion for sumo. She won silver in the World Games in 2013, and has been Brazilian champion fourteen times. But she still faces prejudice because of it... As she told Outlook's Katy Sheriff. Carlos Magdalena from Spain is known as "the Plant Messiah" because of his ability to save plants that are at risk of extinction. Outlook's Saskia Edwards went to meet him at London's Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, to find out more. Image: homeless man sleeping in the streets of London Credit: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Show less
