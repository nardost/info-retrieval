Anne McElvoy talks to the Booker prize winner, Kazuo Ishiguro about his new novel, The Buried Giant - a kind of Arthurian quest for the 21st century which explores the boundaries between memory and forgetting. And with two new productions of Sophocles' play Antigone on stage in London, she is joined in studio by the Greek scholar and translator Oliver Taplin and the playwright Roy Williams to assess the reasons for the tragedy's enduring appeal. Antigone, starring Juliette Binoche, is at the Barbican Theatre from March 4th - 28th. Roy Williams' version of Antigone, performed by Pilot Theatre and co-commissioned by Derby Theatre, runs at London's Stratford East Theatre from 24th February to March 14th. If you still have an appetite for tragedy after that, tune in to Radio 3's Sunday Drama on March 8th. Kristin Scott Thomas will be starring as Electra in a version by Frank McGuiness which was first staged at the Old Vic Theatre. Oliver Taplin's Sophocles: Four Tragedies is published later this March by Oxford University Press.
