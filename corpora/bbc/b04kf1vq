An all new Henry IV runs at the Donmar Warehouse until 29th November and Anne McElvoy talks to Phyllida Lloyd about playing Shakespeare in a female prison and what this particular history play has to tell us about territory and britain's porous borders. Two great german artists go head to head; Anselm Kiefer is at the Royal Academy until December 14th whilst the late Sigmar Polke has a huge retrospective called Alibis at Tate Modern. Tim Marlow, Head of the R.A. together with art historian, Karen Lang, and experienced Germany-watcher and Standpoint Editor, Daniel Johnson discuss reading history through the paintings of Kiefer and Polke ahead of next month's 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall. And the man often touted as France's greatest writer has just won this year's Nobel prize for Literature. Anne talks the contribution of Patrick Modiano to film as well as literature with Ian Christie and Akane Kawakami. Producer: Jacqueline Smith. Show less
