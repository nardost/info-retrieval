THE ATTAINMENT GAP Laurie Taylor presents a special series of three programmes to examine the social gaps which most concern researchers in todayâ€™s divided Britain: the residential gap, the generation gap and the class gap. Laurie is joined by two policy makers throughout the series, the Conservative MP David Willetts and the Labour MP Frank Field; in this third part they discuss the attainment gap together with two academic experts Leon Feinstein and John Goldthorpe. They consider a rather more traditional and enduring difference between the educational attainments of working class and middle class children and how it perpetuates the disadvantages of poorer families.
