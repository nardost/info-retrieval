Bola Mosuro explores attitudes towards sex and sexuality in her country of origin, Nigeria. Talking openly about sex, desire and pleasure is still mostly a no-go area - especially if you are a woman. Today, however, women are breaking through religious and cultural barriers to claim equality in the bedroom. Bola travels to Lagos to talk to men and women of different generations and backgrounds about what they want out of their sexual relationships, and what they have grown up expecting and been told. She explores society's attitudes towards intimacy, sexual fulfilment, lust and love - in and outside marriage. And, she spends time with the woman who set up Nigeria's first online sex-aids shop - despite the death threats. (Photo: Young African woman on a bed. Credit: Thinkstock) Show less
