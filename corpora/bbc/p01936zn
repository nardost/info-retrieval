In her early years Mary Williams grew up in a commune run by the Black Panthers, a radical black activist group. But a chance family connection transported her to an arts summer camp run by Hollywood star Jane Fonda - it opened her eyes to a whole new world. The music Festival in the Desert, in Mali, has attracted top African musicians to play alongside western superstars like Bono of U2. But, when Islamist extremists took control of northern Mali, they banned all music - and the festival was forced to close down. We talk to the organiser Manny Ansar, who has just been in Geneva to receive an award at the United Nations headquarters, recognising his contribution to freedom of artistic expression. Amongst the pomp and ceremony of the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's coronation this week - one woman stood out from the rest. As the procession moved up the aisle of the historic Westminster Abbey, all eyes were drawn to the high visibility jacket of school crossing patrol supervisor, Victoria Adom. She is originally from Ghana, but has lived in the UK for 17 years. (Image: Mary Williams (left) and Jane Fonda (right). Credit: Blue Rider Press/Mary Williams) Show less
