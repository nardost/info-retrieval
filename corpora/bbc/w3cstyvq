In June 2013, heavy rains in northern India left thousands stranded in the mountains by flooding and landslides. Vijendra Singh Rathore's wife Leela was one of those people. He began searching for her and continued to do so even when a death certificate was issued by authorities a month after the floods. Have you ever had a question, which you'd love to know the answer to? How many teeth does a great white shark have? How do slugs find lettuces in the garden? Well it's James Souce's job to find out the answers, he works in a team of people in New York's public library who spend their days answering a myriad of strange questions. Outlook's Colm Flynn tried out the service. Juan Carlos Delgado is quite a well known figure at home in Spain, he's even had a film made about his life. He was one of Spain's most prolific car thieves and has since turned his life around helping kids who are making some bad choices to clean up their act. Nuno Santos is from a town in Portugal called Nazar√© and plays the violin while surfing some of the biggest waves in the world. He's currently working on building a carbon fibre violin that's better adapted for his extreme activities.
