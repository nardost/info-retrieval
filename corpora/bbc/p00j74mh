Could the current Eurozone crisis signal the start of terminal decline for the continent? Or is there something about Europe's rich cultural vibrancy that will help it through the current troubles? Or perhaps the real reason why civilisations come and go has nothing to do with human activity but the knock on effects of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other forces of nature we cannot control. This week's guests are Greek archaeologist, Yannis Hamilakis, British volcano expert, Clive Oppenheimer, and from Latvia, the country’s first female President and authority on Latvia’s oral folk tradition, Vaira Vike-Freiberga.
