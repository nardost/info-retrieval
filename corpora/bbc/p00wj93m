Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, as remote controlled drones play an increasing part in modern warfare, Matthew Bannister talks to a US major who operated them. We also hear from two young Bosnians in Sarajevo about their hopes for a better and more inclusive future for their country, and from a man who's spent 26 years searching for Scotland's elusive Loch Ness monster.
