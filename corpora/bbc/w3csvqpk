Min Zaw Oo is a Burmese Guerrilla turned top negotiator, who's fighting to end decades of insurgency in Myanmar. As a young man he joined a student militia that was fighting the military government, but an epiphany in the jungle led him to reconsider his future. An opportunity to study in the USA presented itself, and he wrote his scholarship application from a trench. We often hear from women on the programme who have broken into some traditionally male domain and made a success of it. But in this case Pau Ribes is a man who's broken into a traditionally female domain. He's a 22 year old from Spain, and from the age of seven, he's been obsessed with synchronised swimming, but he had to fight for the right to compete.
