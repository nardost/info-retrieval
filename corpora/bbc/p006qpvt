Mary Kayitesi Blewitt Fifty members of Mary Kayitesi Blewitt's extended family were among the estimated one million people killed in the Rwandan genocide in 1994. For the last sixteen years, Mary has been working tirelessly to help the traumatised survivors. She founded and ran a charity which has received international recognition. When the genocide happened, Mary was living between London and Ethiopia. It was then that she received the news that her brother had been killed and her journey began. Mary's book "You Alone May Live" will be published in April. Galapagos fishermen turned tour guides The Galapagos Islands are best known as a natural paradise with unique animals and beautiful landscapes, which inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.

Some have turned their traditional skills into a tourist attraction called artisanal fishing. Podalirio Herrera is one of the fishermen who has been teaching his trade to the tourists.

So when he retired after twenty years' military service, he decided to put things right. Show less
