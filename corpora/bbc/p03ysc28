Lhakpa Sherpa was born in Nepal but for the last 15 years she has been working as a housekeeper in the American state of Connecticut. She broke her own world record by reaching the summit of Mount Everest for an incredible seventh time. She has been up there more times than any other woman. Lhakpa grew up with her 11 brothers and sisters in rural Nepal in the 1970s. Like many girls in the country, she did not go to school. But unlike other girls, she started climbing mountains as a teenager. Erick Karangwa was born in Rwanda but when war broke out, he was sent abroad by his family to safety. Erick, who works part time as a car guard, spent much of his childhood in refugee camps, but despite the hardship, he never gave up on his unlikely dream - that one day he would be a professional artist. The American stand up comedian Ms Pat has starred in shows on TV - like Stand Up In Stilettos and Live at Gotham. She has also performed in front of audiences of thousands. Her real name is Patricia Williams and her act revolves around the unlikely subject of her own traumatic childhood - early life as a teenage mother selling drugs on the streets. Gilad Millo has become a pop sensation in Kenya, singing in both English and Swahili. But a lot of his fans have been surprised to discover that he is actually an Israeli ex-diplomat in his mid-40s. When our reporter Andrea Kidd went to meet him in Nairobi, Gilad told her how he discovered that his first song Unajua had gone to number one. (Photo: Gilad Millo (L) Credit: Zollo.
