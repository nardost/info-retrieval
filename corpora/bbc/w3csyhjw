Diagnosed with polio as a child in Sudan, Malat Wei crawled for nine years before he got his first wheelchair. Now a wheelchair basketball star in the US and with the help of coach, Jess Markt, they told Emily Webb how and why they are taking the sport back to South Sudan. To mark 500 years since the death of the Italian Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci we bring you two stories of people keeping his legacy alive. The first is from Italy - Alessandro Vezzosi and Agnese Sabato are a couple on a quest to trace his DNA. The second is from the USA's top art restorer Dianne Modestini. When she was asked to work on an old, damaged painting in 2005, she had no idea it would go on to become the worldâ€™s most expensive. The painting of Christ was believed to be inspired by Leonardo da Vinci, but was eventually attributed to the artist himself. It went on to sell at auction for US $450,000,000. Dianne's relationship with the picture was deeply emotional, connecting her to her late husband, himself a noted conservator. Show less
