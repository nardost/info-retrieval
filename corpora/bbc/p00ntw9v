Extraordinary personal stories from around the world Today, another chance to hear from Clarence B Jones, Dr Martin Luther King's speech writer, lawyer and confidant. Clarence was part of Dr King's inner circle of advisors and helped to organise the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which culminated in the civil rights leader giving his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech to a reported 250,000 people. Clarence who helped to draft the speech, stood behind Dr King as he uttered the words that have gone down in history and says that the atmosphere was like "capturing lightning in a bottle". His book is called Behind the Dream: The Making of a Speech that Transformed a Nation. (Image: Martin Luther King during his 'I Have a Dream' speech at the Lincoln Memorial, August 28th 1963.
