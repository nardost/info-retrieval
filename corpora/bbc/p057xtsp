Seventy years ago, India and Pakistan became independent nations - but at a cost. People and lands were partitioned, and a once shared heritage was broken apart. Kanishk Tharoor explores artefacts and landmarks that were caught up in the events around 1947. Part one looks at the tussle for ancient history, including the prized artefacts of the Indus Valley civilization. There was a bureaucratic saga over the fates of the priest-king, the dancing girl, and the jade necklace so precious to both India and Pakistan that neither country could let the other have it whole. And in part two, the conflict in Kashmir told through the life and times of a burnt-out movie theatre - Srinagarâ€™s Palladium cinema.
