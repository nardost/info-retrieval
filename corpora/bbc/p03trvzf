The dancer, Dane Hurst, has bought a former Rambert Company dance floor (deep, protective, roll out vinyl) to take back to his home in South Africa, for under-privileged kids to dance on. Modern Dance is like a magic carpet. It transported young Dane out of the volatility, violence and poverty of his childhood in segregated Port Elizabeth, to life as a Rambert student and dancer in London. He believes it can transport other young people. Buying the floor was the start of a larger dream that Dane calls the Moving Assembly Project (MAP). Dane plans in the next few years to construct a prototype dance space out of shipping containers in Port Elizabeth, SA and to install the floor in it - to give dance training to thousands of underprivileged children, to transport them for a moment out of their frustrations and grief.
