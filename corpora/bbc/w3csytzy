In the 1970s, second wave feminists declared war on make-up - arguing it oppressed women, distracted them from gaining equality, and forced them to attain a beauty ideal not expected of men. And yet young women today wear more make-up than ever. Women have made gains in employment, education, sexual liberation, so why is it so many of us canâ€™t leave the house without make-up? We explore the power and allure of mak-eup and why it works. Presented and Produced by Gemma Newby Editor: Richard Knight (Photo: Young woman vlogging about beauty products.
