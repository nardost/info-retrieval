The British doctor Judith Mackay was labelled by some in the tobacco industry as one of the three most dangerous people in the world. Judith saw so many patients in 1970s Hong Kong suffering from smoking-related diseases that she started campaigning, hard, against cigarettes. When blogging started to take off in the mid-2000s, people got very excited about how the internet was democratising debate. These personal websites, where anyone who wanted to could publish their thoughts and feelings, seemed to be saying that anyone's voice could be heard. That included eleven year olds girls like Tavi Gevinson whose fashion blog was a big hit. She's been speaking to Outlook's Saskia Edwards. We’re also in Colombia meeting an inventor who's modelled himself on his favourite screen heroes from James Bond to The A-Team to MacGyver. Our reporter Clayton Conn spoke to the creative force that is Felipe Bentacur. Image and credit: Judith Mackay Show less
