In November 2018, the Sentinelese tribe in the Andaman Islands hit the headlines after an American missionary was killed by arrows as he attempted to approach their isolated island. Very few people have come close to this remote community, but one person who has is Indian anthropologist Dr Madhumala Chattopadhyay. She was part of a team from the Anthropological Society of India who made friendly contact with the tribe in 1991. She tells Rihanna Dhillon about their extraordinary trip. Jim Nollman is what's known as an "interspecies musician". A guitarist, he was playing in his backyard when a turkey started responding to his music...and the recording he made became a hit! Since then he's spent decades playing music to creatures like wolves and whales, and recorded their surprising responses. Dr Ricardo Pun is a man on a mission. For years, he witnessed families in Peru who couldn't afford a place to stay while their children were in hospital. Shocked by the conditions they were forced to endure, he decided to build a place where families whose children had been diagnosed with cancer, could sleep and rest while they were getting treatment.
