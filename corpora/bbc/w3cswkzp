S. McEachin Otts - known as Mac - grew up in Greensboro, Alabama. His great great grandfather had slaves and a plantation there, but as Mac grew up he began to go against the racism he was used to and he adopted a mixed race child. Mac has written a book about his life called Better than them: The Unmaking of an Alabama Racist, published by NewSouth Books, Montgomery, Alabama. In 2003, a band of expert criminals had masterminded the biggest and boldest jewel heist in history, but Belgian diamond detective Patrick Peys was on their trail. A strange assortment of clues, including a carpet and a salami sandwich, led to a mysterious criminal mastermind and a school for felons. Emily Webb has the story. (Image: Mac Otts.
