Unprecedented mass protests have caused chaos in Hong Kong’s public sphere – but what has it meant for private life? How have they affected the increasing number of couples who have married across the divide, with one partner from Hong Kong and another from the Chinese mainland? As part of Crossing Divides, bringing people together in a fragmented world, BBC World Affairs correspondent Paul Adams hears from one such couple, for whom the political has become personal. ‘Daniel’ is a native-born Hong Kong citizen, while his wife ‘Jane’ moved to the city from the Chinese mainland. They are happily married – but are living in a metropolis riven by discontent. How do they navigate the expectations of their friends, families and workplaces and most importantly their spouse – while staying true to their own beliefs? This single marriage reveals a great deal about the emerging, troubled identity of Hong Kong.
