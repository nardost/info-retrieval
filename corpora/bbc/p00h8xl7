Extraordinary personal stories from around the world: today, Samia, the female surgeon from Saudi Arabia who's battling for the right to marry the man she loves - she's now planning to take her case to the Supreme Court. Also on the programme, Tim Durrin, the American Iraq war veteran who's formed an unlikely friendship with a Cambodian through their love of cycling. And growing up poor in the UK - in the third part of our series, we hear from Paige, a ten year old girl who lives in Glasgow - she describes how damp and mouldy living conditions make her family ill.
