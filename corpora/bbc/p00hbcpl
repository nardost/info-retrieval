Leading British industrialist and pioneer of automation Sir Leon Bagrit continues his Reith lectures. He is the Chairman and Managing Director of Elliott Automation Ltd one of the first companies in Europe devoted to automation and speaks on this topic in his series entitled 'The Age of Automation'. In this lecture entitled 'Automation and New Opportunities for Social Enrichment', Sir Bagrit argues that widespread computerization is vital for Britain to compete in a global market. He considers the possible improvements for daily life that could change Britain's status and keep it at the forefront of technology. This is vital, Sir Bagrit argues, in order to prove that The United Kingdom is still is a world leader. Show less
