From TV talent contests such as The Great British Bake Off and Strictly Come Dancing to the pressures of school exams and job interviews - competition is at the heart of the way we live our lives. What can we learn from sports stars whose lives are geared to cultivating a healthy competitive instinct? Is the desire to be successful bringing out the best in us - or the worst? Constructively and co-operatively arguing with Free Thinking presenter Anne McElvoy are: Margaret Heffernan, entrepreneur, CEO and author of A Bigger Prize: Why Competition isn't Everything and Willful Blindness Matthew Syed, former England Table Tennis number one and Times columnist and author whose books include Bounce: The myth of talent and the power of practice and, most recently, Black Box Thinking: The Surprising Truth about Success. Cath Bishop, Olympic medallist and World Champion rower, worked as a British diplomat specialising in conflict issues, working in Bosnia and Iraq and is now a leadership speaker specialising in topics relating to high performance and resilience.
