Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood and guests join a live audience at RSA in London to explore the sometimes tense and at other times inspiring relationship between the individual and society. How do we strike a balance between personal desires and the wider needs of society? And how is this relationship changing in an increasingly globalised world? On the panel: American sociologist and director of the London School of Economics Craig Calhoun, Kenyan psychiatrist and mental health campaigner Frank Njenga and Chinese writer and film-maker Sun Shuyun.
