Four years ago, Karl Williams, went on holiday to Dubai with some friends. He ended up spending a year in prison for possession of a synthetic cannabis called spice. He says he was innocent and that he was tortured by the police. His claims of torture are supported by the British human rights group, Reprieve, and the British prime minister raised it with the president of the United Arab Emirates. The police deny the allegations. After a year in prison, Karl and his friends were pardoned under an amnesty - he has just brought out a book about his experience. Dr Evan Atar from Sudan is one of our Outlook Inspirations. When there was trouble on the border with South Sudan at the end of 2011, he put his life on the line to help people wounded behind rebel lines.
