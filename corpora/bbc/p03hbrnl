Kevin Hines jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco - and survived. The odds were against him - only 1% of jumpers have survived both the fall and the freezing water. But Kevin now shares his story to encourage others to turn their backs on suicidal thoughts. He is making a documentary called Suicide, the Ripple Effect, about how suicide impacts the family and friends of those who attempt it. Park Seo-Bo is 84 years old and regarded as the father of Modern Art in his native South Korea. He is most famous for his series of plain white paintings, which he began in the 1960s in an attempt, he says, to `empty his mind'. Park Seo-Bo lived through the Korean War. He tells the BBC's Nicki Paxman about his memories of that time. For many people living in the Caba√±as region in the north of El Salvador, the name Cristina Starr is a very familiar one. Twenty-two years ago Cristina helped set up a community radio station there called Radio Victoria which is still broadcasting to this day. It not only provides its listeners with news but gives a voice to the poorest and most isolated communities in the area. For Outlook, reporter Nina Lakhani went to meet Cristina and hear her story. Six months ago a 31-year-old Balinese man called I Wayan Sumardana suffered a stroke that paralysed his left arm. He is a welder and mechanic and the sole earner for his young family. Desperate to keep working, he decided to build himself a mechanical arm out of scrap mental and other bits and pieces from his workshop. For Outlook, reporter Christine Franciska spoke to I Wayan and his wife Nengah. (Photo: Sign on The Golden Gate Bridge, California, USA. Credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Show less
