BUILDING IN KABUL Zalmi Gul Niayz was brought up in Afghanistan, but sent to the United States by his parents as a 14 year old to escape the turmoil of the 1970s. He ran a successful construction business, married and had children. But as soon as US forces entered Afghanistan after 9/11, he was on the first plane back. He tells Jo Fidgen that he felt he needed to help rebuild his home country even though this meant having to live apart from his family. BORN WITHOUT LIMBS Australian Nick Vujicic was born without arms or legs, but with just a tiny foot on his left hip. The cause was a very rare congenital disorder called phocomelia. As a child, Nick struggled to accept his condition and wanted to end his life but he kept going, and resolved to make the most of it. He tells Outlook about his childhood depression and his love of practical jokes. Show less
