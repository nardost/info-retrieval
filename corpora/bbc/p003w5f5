Personal stories behind the news from all over the world. With Ritula Shah. On today's programme: Prosecuting war criminals; Cross-border friendship; Child birth defects in Corby. Prosecuting war criminals The conviction this week of Josef Scheungraber for war crimes in the Second World War has put the spotlight on bringing Nazi war criminals to justice. But with the latest war criminal to be convicted being 90 years old, is it possible to secure further convictions? We hear from the Nazi hunter Dr Efrain Zuroff, who heads the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Israel, on the need to bring Nazi war criminals to justice and difficulties he faces. Crossing the border Serbs and Albanians have had a fraught relationship. They've fought each other several times - culminating in the Kosovan war of 1999, when ethnic Albanians rose up against Serbia's control of the Kosovo territory. Even today relations still remain tense. But when a Kosovan Albanian girl got lost and crossed into Serbia, it led to a friendship between two families on either side of the border. Mother's struggle for justice We hear a mother's story of her struggle to find out why her child was born with a deformity. She and 15 other families claim the clearance of contaminated land in the English town of Corby was responsible for their children's birth defects. A legal decision has moved them closer to establishing their claim. The local borough council, which cleared the land, denies there's a link between the land and the deformities. Show less
