We are back on Rikers island – New York’s largest and most notorious jail where Ryan Burvik works with inmates on a unique hip hop program. The jail, conscious of criticism about its treatment of young people – most of whom are on remand, unable to make bail – has invested in a new music studio. We hear Ryan working with Mikey MTA and Zig on raps that express their regrets and their ambition for the future. What is new is the inclusion of women using hip hop as a way of telling their story. We hear from the very talented Remy who used her skill as a performer during her three years in jail to leverage visits from her six year old daughter. We also follow some of the students once they have been released. Not just Remy but Angel and Trigger and Enterprise Wise are all enrolled on Ryan’s internship at his studio in West Queens. They are taking music seriously – could it be a career? Could they even make it as rappers in their own right? We meet Shanell Finney who works for Sony Music. Shanell is enthusiastic about the ‘raw, unfiltered’ nature of the music and thinks the Rikers rappers are up to professional standard - a compilation album is planned. With Ryan we hear some hi energy and accomplished music. We hear his own story too and news of, finally, the closure of Rikers Island. (Photo: MC and producer Ryan Burvick.
