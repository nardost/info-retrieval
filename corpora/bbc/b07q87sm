Last Broadcast Date: Fri 2 Sep 2016
Marshall Rosenberg was the stern faced creator of nonviolent communication, a man who spent his life finding ways to eradicate hate. Often armed only with his trademark giraffe and jackal puppets, Rosenberg toured the world teaching a new way of speaking. Language was key, but to discover the meaning of the puppets you'll have to tune in. Championing Marshall Rosenberg is the comedian and author Tony Hawks, author of Round Ireland with a Fridge and a regular radio guest on shows including I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. A sceptical Matthew Parris presents while David Baker of the London School of Life fills in the biographical gaps. The producer in Bristol is Miles Warde. Show less
