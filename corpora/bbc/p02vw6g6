Top graphene researchers, including the Nobel laureate who first isolated pure graphene, talk to Bridget Kendall about the future of not just this 'wonder-material' but also a whole host of other 2-dimensional crystals now available. How close are we to a cheap production of quality graphene on an industrial scale? Can the EU's Graphene Flagship, a research and industrial consortium which includes about 150 partners in over 20 countries, quickly move graphene products from the lab to the consumer? And should we worry about the safety of 2D materials? Recorded at Graphene Week held at the University of Manchester, with Sir Konstantin Novoselov, Sarah Haigh, Jari Kinaret, Toby Heys and Jonathan Coleman.
