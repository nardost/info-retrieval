After being jailed for her art, Kurdish journalist Zehra Doğan's paint supplies were confiscated. She was charged with peddling terrorist propaganda when she drew a scene of a destroyed Kurdish-majority city in southern Turkey. In prison, she asked fellow inmates to give her their menstrual blood to use as paint. Meanwhile, her case caught the attention of the world and famous street artist Banksy painted a mural in New York calling for her release. New York used to be famous for its oysters – which could be fished straight out of the city's harbour. But the oysters proved too tempting for diners, and over-exploitation along with pollution meant they disappeared. Pete Malinowski is a man who's determined to bring them back by building a reef in New York harbour. Outlook’s Tara Gadomski has been to meet him. Growing up during the Cultural Revolution, Guo Pei didn’t know what fashion was. As a kid, she wasn’t allowed to wear anything but a blue or green uniform. These days, she’s China’s most famous fashion designer, and some of her embroidered couture creations are worth millions. Guo's story has been told in a documentary called "Yellow is Forbidden".
