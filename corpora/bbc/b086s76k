Step though the wardrobe on Great Lives as CS Lewis - creator of the Narnia Chronicles - is this week's choice. Lewis was a fascinating and extremely complicated man. Born in Northern Ireland, his mother died when he was a child, and his university career interrupted so he could go off and fight in the Great War. Historian Suzannah Lipscomb, who tweets as sixteenth century girl, says she finds his writings deeply moving and that they have influenced her faith. Matthew Parris is less convinced by the religious influence in his work. Malcolm Guite, contributer to the Cambridge Companion to CS Lewis, sits firmly on Suzannah Lipscomb's side. The producer in Bristol is Miles Warde. Show less
