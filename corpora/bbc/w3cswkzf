Maria Hamilton and Doretha Lock were united by the shooting of their sons in the US. Maria went on to create Mothers for Justice, which is an organisation aimed at supporting the families of people affected by police violence. They told Jo Fidgen their story. There's a forest in Mexico that's a resting spot for the magnificent monarch butterfly. Outlook's Saskia Edwards went to meet Jose Luis Alvarez at his nursery. He founded Forests For Monarchs and has helped plant millions of trees, which have ensured the survival of the butterflies. Philippe Charlier is a French doctor who works with patients who have already died - sometimes many hundreds of years ago. Outlook's reporter John Laurenson went to meet him at his research centre in Paris - and had quite a surprise.
