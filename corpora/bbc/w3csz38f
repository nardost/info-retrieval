Aged eleven, Dirce de Assis Cavalcanti was taunted by one of her classmates. She was called the "daughter of a murderer". Not long after, Dirce found out that her father had indeed killed a man and not just any man, he’d killed one of Brazil’s celebrated authors, a national treasure. Although he was cleared by the courts, who declared the shooting an act of self-defence, in the court of public opinion Dirce’s dad was condemned. The story behind that fateful killing is one of love, betrayal and revenge. And it is a story that throughout her life Dirce has grappled with in her attempts to rebuild her family’s reputation.
