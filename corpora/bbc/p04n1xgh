Aminah Hart gave birth to her daughter using a sperm donor in Australia. She had wanted to track him down to see if he was open to meeting her daughter when she turned 18. But Aminah never expected that when she did meet the donor, Scott Anderson, it would be her own relationship with him which would blossom. US Army interpreter Nayyef Hrebid and Iraqi soldier Betu Allami met and fell in love during the height of the Iraq War. But how did their love survive in a country where same-sex relationships are taboo, and gay people are often at risk of violent attacks? A rare condition means Johanna Watkins is allergic to pretty much everyone including her husband Scott. Now they cannot be in the same room and have to communicate with each other over the internet from different parts of the house. (Photo: Heart made from hands.
