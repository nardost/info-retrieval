GANG CULTURE Stories of gang conflict often hit the headlines. Commentators hark back to a golden age in which British streets were safe. But did such an age ever exist? Andrew Davies is the author of a new book which describes the gangs who waged turf war in Victorian Manchester. The Scuttlers emerged from the squalid slums of the Industrial Revolution, fighting for fun, with belts and knives. In response, some called for the Lash and others for lads clubs. Laurie Taylor is joined by Andrew Davies, Senior Lecturer in history and author of The Gangs of Manchester, Geoffrey Pearson, Professor of Criminology and Tara Young, a Senior Research Fellow who is currently carrying out research into the nature of gang membership. They explore the historical hoodie and discuss what the past can reveal about the causes and cures for gang violence? Show less
