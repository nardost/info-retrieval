Despite the dangers, he plans to carry on climbing. Food writer Claudia Roden recalls her childhood in Egypt - and bringing Middle Eastern delicacies to the West. She's since won an international reputation for her books, which explore the history and culture behind different dishes. The American singer-songwriter Tori Amos tells us about her powerful songs which reveal her own personal traumas.
