The BBC’s Katy Watson travels to Los Angeles and asks why feminism is still regarded by many as a word to avoid. Despite an ongoing gender pay gap, and a lack of female business-leaders, why does the word continue to raise an eyebrow? Is the new and more palatable word - "empowerment" – something that focuses more on individual achievements rather than a collective movement for equal rights? Why is empowerment proving to be a great marketing tool, but feminism is not? Katy hears from the self-styled “factual feminist” Christina Hoff Sommers, of the American Enterprise Institute, on why modern feminists may have gone too far. She speaks to Ana Flores of We All Grow Latina, who explains why many US Latinas prefer to brand themselves as feminine rather than feminist. Katy also meets the feminist campaigners behind the iconic Ms Magazine, as well as the co-founder of Amy Poehler's Smart Girls, Meredith Walker, who explains why young girls need better role models, especially online. And, Katy travels to the Hollywood Hills to see positive body image pioneer, Jess Weiner, who helped reshape Barbie into a more human-looking form, and has become an iconic figures in the battle for confidence. Plus, Katy explores her own feminist journey, as she prepares to give birth to a little boy. (Photo: Ana Flores of We All Grow Latina, courtesy of A.Flores) Show less
