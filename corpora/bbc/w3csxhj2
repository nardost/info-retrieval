How has comedy helped Northern Ireland cope with conflict and move on? An atheist is driving in Belfast and he gets stopped by a paramilitary road block. A paramilitary walks up to the window and asks him "Catholic or Protestant?" The atheists looks at him and says "well I'm an atheist" The paramilitary nods "Ah okay, but are you a Catholic or a Protestant atheist?" Northern Ireland is renowned for its friendliness and sense of humour but after 40 years of violence how do you keep laughing? The conflict has brought out a very particular brand of humour unique to the country, much darker than the Irish humour and sharper than the Scottish. Comedian Diona Doherty (star of Derry Girls and Soft Border Patrol) finds out what comedy can tell us about healing in conflict and what young people think of the future of NI post Brexit and without a government. Speaking with stars of the past and future she hears how the jokes have changed even if some of the issues havenâ€™t. Along with her former comedy partner Jordan Dunbar they set out to find the man with the darkest sense of humour in Belfast. How has comedy evolved and what can it tell us about how to live in a country without a government? (Photo Credit: Getty Images) Show less
