How does our brain perceive time passing? Is there such a thing as a ‘now’, and if so, how long is it, exactly? And, why do we sometimes feel that time has slowed down or even stopped altogether, for instance when listening to music or in extreme situations? Helping to explain the latest thinking and research about time, the brain and the world are cognitive neuroscientist Virginie van Wassenhove, writer Shumon Basar, author of a new book about an ‘extreme present’, and Lawrence Zbikowski, professor of Music at the University of Chicago.
