Lucia Lantero is a Spanish scientist, who volunteered to work in Haiti in the wake of the catastrophic earthquake. She was so affected by the plight of the street children there, that she ended up setting up an orphanage - and she is still running it three years on. We speak to Alberto Cairo, an Italian physiotherapist who has been helping Afghans injured in the war to become more independent by giving them artificial limbs. Andras Schiff is a pianist who emigrated from Hungary in 1979 and has lived in self-imposed exile ever since. He is about to celebrate his 60th birthday, and he's been telling our reporter Mark Coles about his low-key approach to life. Robin Coningham is a British archaeologist who's always been fascinated by South Asia. Over the last three years he's been excavating a sacred site in Nepal, and he's made a discovery that may change our understanding about the birth of the Buddha.
