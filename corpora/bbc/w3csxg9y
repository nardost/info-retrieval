What can be done to counter the spread of false and misleading information on social media? Sir David Spiegelhalter, Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at Cambridge University, has been travelling to classrooms around the world for a World Service documentary examining new strategies to combat the phenomenon. Ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London in April 2018, David talks to a group of the Commonwealth's brightest young minds about the challenges of assessing the truthfulness of claims in the news today. The six participants, drawn from the Commonwealth's affiliated youth organisations, discuss the issues affecting social media in their home countries and how they work to distinguish fact from fiction.
