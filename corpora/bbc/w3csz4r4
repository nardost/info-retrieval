Everyone knows how China is changing Africa but what is less well known is how Africa is changing China. Linda Yueh uncovers the growing number of Africans who are moving to work and live in China. As China looks to continue expanding their One Belt One Road project into Africa, Africans are looking to take advantage of China’s growth and eagerness to build economic partnerships. African traders and students are moving to China to seek out opportunities. But things are not always easy. Linda Yueh investigates problems some African’s are having obtaining Chinese visas, and instances of perceived racism. But Linda also hears success stories of African businessman now employing local Chinese workers and reasons why Africans prefer China over western countries to make their life. Finally Linda explores if the Chinese are willing to accept living side by side with a new African community keen to explore opportunities in their homeland. Producer: Rajeev Gupta Show less
