On today's programme: Ruchama Morton, Malaysian Ice Hockey and Cathrine Ann RUCHAMA MARTON Dr Ruchama Marton is an Israeli psychiatrist who campaigns for Palestinians to have equal access to health care. Earlier this month, the organisation she founded, Physicians for Human Rights - Israel, was awarded the Right Livelihood Award, better known as the Alternative Nobel Prize. She talks to Jo Fudgen about her work and the death threats she's received. MALAYSIAN ICE HOCKEY Ice hockey is a very popular sport in cold countries, with reliable ice cover. It's less well suited to tropical countries, like Malaysia, where the average temperature is 27 degrees centigrade. But the Malaysian national ice hockey team has set itself the goal of finishing in the top three in next year's Asian Winter Games in Kazakhstan. Outlook's Jennifer Pak in Kuala Lumpur has been talking to Allan Yeoh, the team's captain, who's given up his job in the hope of fulfilling his dream to win a medal. CATHRINE ANN Cathrine Ann runs a successful, multi-million dollar company in Canada supplying mystery shoppers to check the quality of customer service. She's won numerous awards for entrepreneurship. But she took a roundabout route to the top - via prostitution, drug-dealing and sleeping rough. She told Jo Fidgen about her difficult childhood and her relationship with her father. Cathrine Ann's book Beautiful Buttons is on sale now. Show less
