Last Broadcast Date: Tue 4 Nov 2014
Andriy Kravets meets Mustafa Nayyem, one of Ukraine's leading investigative reporters, who has controversially decided to leave journalism and enter the political arena. Mustafa was a leading voice in the Maidan protests and journalists like him are vital in a country where corruption is rife and politicians are open to bribery. So, it was all the more shocking when back in September he revealed he was to seek a new career as a politician - switching sides in this way left people speechless and many saw it as a massive betrayal of his ideals. Andriy Kravets from the BBCâ€™s Ukrainian Service travelled back to his homeland ahead of the recent parliamentary elections to find out more about Mustafa. How did an immigrant boy from Afghanistan manage to make his mark in Ukrainian society? And has this leading anti-corruption campaigner sold his audience short - or is this an attempt to kick-start much-need changes in Ukraine's political culture?
