On Start the Week Stephanie Flanders asks the head of the British Red Cross, Sir Nick Young, whether the charity's principle of neutrality is still as relevant today as it was 150 years ago. The journalist Lindsey Hilsum has reported on the major international conflicts and atrocities in the last few decades and wrestles with the moral complexities of being neutral and impartial. Making judgements about who deserves to be helped and how many, concerns the economist Paul Collier, as he attempts to defuse the explosive subject of immigration. And the Conservative MP Kwasi Kwarteng proposes selling working visas to the highest bidder. Producer: Katy Hickman. Show less
