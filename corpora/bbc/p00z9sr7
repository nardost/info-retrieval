Last Broadcast Date: Thu 25 Oct 2012
Prominent Jamaican gay rights activist Gareth Henry tells us why he felt he had to flee his homeland. He now lives in Canada, from where he is working with the Human Dignity Trust to get the law criminalising homosexuality in Jamaica changed. Also, Spanish screenwriter Albert Espinosa describes how his life was changed by a cancer diagnosis at the age of 14. His book is called The Yellow World. And live in the studio, the favourite hymn of the English Baroque Choir. We hope to get suggestions of much-loved hymns from our listeners. We want to choose one for a thanksgiving service on 12 December to mark the end of the World Service's 80th anniversary year. Email your favourite to outlook@bbc.com and say why it is special to you.
