As the UK heads towards a highly competitive general election with an uncertain outcome, Mary Ann Sieghart explores how the parties are planning to form a government if there is no clear winner. Like much of Europe, Britainâ€™s traditional two-party system is fragmenting and smaller parties are gaining significant ground. But the British first-past-the-post, winner-takes-all model is not designed for these new politics. Mary Ann Sieghart speaks to key figures in the negotiations over a coalition government after the last general election, and hears how the parties are planning for what might happen this time around.
