Aziz Amir's mother died of blood poisoning when he was nine years old, because she refused to be treated by a male doctor. Aziz was inspired to become a doctor himself and has now set up Afghanistan's first women-only university to train more female medical staff. Kazuhiro Tsjui is an award winning makeup artist who's in charge of turning Hollywood actors into a wide array of characters, from Winston Churchill to the hairy antagonists of the Planet of the Apes. He also made a major impact on The Grinch and Men In Black. San Carlos is a small town about four hours drive from Medellin in Colombia. It's in a beautiful area but it's also been a place filled with horror - the tragic consequence of the violence inflicted by right-wing paramilitaries and left-wing guerillas. Following a ceasefire, people are returning to San Carlos, and former paramilitaries and guerillas are living next door to their victims. Our reporter Dimitri O'Donnell has been to meet them.
