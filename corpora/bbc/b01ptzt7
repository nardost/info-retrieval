Neo liberalism - its genesis and development. Laurie Taylor talks to Daniel Stedman Jones, the author of a new book which traces the origins of neo liberal economics. Also, the enduring and complex relationship between race and music. Laurie meets Jo Haynes, the author of a new study which considers the significance of race to the understanding of music genres and preferences. What does the 'love of difference' via music contribute to contemporary perspectives on racism? The research draws on interviews with people from the British world music scene.
