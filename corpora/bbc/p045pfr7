Marguerite Barankitse, nicknamed the Angel of Burundi, has helped thousands of children - of all ethnic origins - displaced by war. She set up Maison Shalom, the House of Peace, in 1993, a shelter providing children displaced by Burundi's civil war with refuge, medical care and education. It involved tremendous risks - and other people called her 'Maggy the Madwoman'. She tells Jo Fidgen how she started - and why. Quincy Jones, the celebrated musician and producer on his early life growing up in 1930s Chicago to his work with Michael Jackson, where he had to choose the best songs - out of a mere 800 - for the Thriller album. Ann Rodgers is a 72 year old woman who went on a road trip that went horribly wrong. She was en route though the Arizona desert to see her family when her hybrid car ran out of fuel. She then had to survive for nine days with just her cat and dog for company, crackers and chocolate spread for food, but thankfully a very resourceful brain. (Picture: Marguerite Barankitse.
