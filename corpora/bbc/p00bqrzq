Linda Norgrove was the British aid worker who died when American soldiers were trying to rescue her from kidnappers in Afghanistan. Linda had been involved in infrastructure projects for farmers in Eastern Afghanistan. At the end of September she was kidnapped by militants, and two weeks later US soldiers mounted a rescue attempt during which she was killed. At first, official statements said she'd died when one of her kidnappers detonated a suicide vest. But the American authorities later said it was more likely that she was killed by a grenade thrown by a would-be rescuer. An official inquiry is still going on. Linda Norgrove was brought up on the remote Scottish island of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides. Her father John, is a retired civil engineer and her mother Lorna runs the family's croft - or small farm - on the island. John and Lorna share with Outlook their memories of their daughter. Show less
