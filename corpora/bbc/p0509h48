Christine Hyung-Oak Lee had a stroke at the unusually young age of 33. It happened whilst she was on holiday in California, with her then husband, Adam. On the morning of New Year's Eve 2006 she woke up with a bad headache, but thought nothing of it, until she was rushed to hospital. After her stroke Christine began taking notes of her experiences because her memory had started to wipe itself every fifteen minutes. Mauricio Hoyos Padilla is known as the man who high-fives great white sharks. The Mexican marine biologist is a leader in shark research and his love for the animal means he's even swum along side one of the largest great whites ever filmed. Prafulla Samantara spent twelve years trying to stop an open-pit bauxite mine that threatened the way of life of an indigenous tribe in the Niyamgiri Hills of eastern India. His campaign won a significant victory in the Supreme Court and he has since been awarded the prestigious Goldman Prize for his efforts. (Picture: Christine Hyung-Oak Lee.
