Grant Achatz grew up around his family's diner, and by the age of 12 was working there as a cook. He insisted on putting parsley on the omelettes he prepared, which his father scorned as unnecessary 'fanciness'. Little did his father know that it was this exact fanciness that would propel Grant to being one of the best chefs in the world, and to running what's been called the best restaurant in America. But at the same time as his success, Grant was given a shock diagnosis. He had tongue cancer and could lose his life. Even if he survived, he was likely to lose his sense of taste. So how did he continue to cook? Image: Grant Achatz in his kitchen Credit: Getty Images/Juan Naharro Gimenez Show less
