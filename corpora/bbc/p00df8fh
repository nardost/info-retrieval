The Forum has travelled from London to the Galle Literary Festival at the Galle Fort on the South Western tip of Sri Lanka. The Forum takes a closer look at Sri Lanka as it emerges from the devastating civil war that lasted a quarter of a century and ended less than two years ago. Joining Bridget Kendall are three guests who all deal in different ways with the challenges that emerge once the guns have been silenced. Sunila Abeysekera, a leading human rights campaigner in Sri Lanka, who has grass roots experiences of what happens to communities during and after the war. Anjali Watson, a wildlife conservation researcher whose work focuses on the way humans interacts with their environment and in particular on the Sri Lankan leopard. And providing insights about the long term traces of war on peopleâ€™s internal landscapes is award winning Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.
