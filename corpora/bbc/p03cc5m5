Manveen meets the Dhnie family - Mum, Dad and three children in Turkey as they prepare to make the journey to Greece. They are soon negotiating with smugglers, looking for life jackets and in the hours and hours of waiting, dreaming about their future in Europe. But faced with the dangers of crossing the sea on a rubber boat or walking through bear infested forests, the journey is far from easy. We've heard the news of migrants drowning, of queues at borders and reception centres but, in a short news report, it's impossible to capture the detail of the journey hundreds of thousands of Syrians have made. The nights spent sleeping rough, running out of money and the nagging questionâ€¦is it worth it? For five weeks this year reporter Manveen Rana travelled with one Syrian family. A New Life in Europe is an intimate account of that journey as it gets tougher and the family begin to doubt they have made the right decision. Image: The Dhnie family Credit: Manveen Rana Show less
