When Syrian Tamim Kbarh did a call-out on social media offering to help people improve their curriculum vitae, he got more than he bargained for. An impressive CV from Rahaf Al Iymoni dropped into his inbox and it was love at first resume. But he was in Turkey and she in Syria. It would take a challenging three year journey and a virtual wedding for them to meet face to face.
