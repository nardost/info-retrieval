Lisa Hallett has created a running phenomenon. Her group has 15,000 members who meet across the United States on the weekends and also hold races and running events. Many come from military families and running means much more to them them than just keeping fit. The inspiration behind all this is Lisa's husband, John. What would it be like to be born into captivity, and have no idea that the world outside even existed? This is the scenario created by the Irish author Emma Donoghue in her novel Room, which was also made into an Oscar-winning film this year. Room tells the story of bright, curious five-year-old boy called Jack, who has spent his entire life living in a windowless, 10-by-10-foot space with his mother. Unbeknown to him the man they call 'Old Nick', is holding them both captive. Emma Donoghue talked to Kirsty Lang about process of turning her book into a screenplay. Guatemalan musician Gabriel Yela was part of the popular group Los Traviesos or 'the naughty ones' who carried on playing throughout much of the country's 36-year-civil war, despite losing two of their members to the conflict. But it was last year's corruption scandal involving the country's top politicians that finally moved Gabriel to take to the streets and participate in a wave of protests. For Outlook, reporter Nina Lakhani went to meet him and hear his remarkable story. At the age of six, Michael Haddad from Beirut had a jet ski accident, which left him with 75 percent body paralysis. Michael worked hard to take his first steps - and later on he registered three world records in climbing and walking. But he's also an environmental activist and he's planted thousands of cedar trees in his beloved Lebanon. (Picture: Lisa Hallett. Credit - Wear Blue: Run to Remember.) Show less
