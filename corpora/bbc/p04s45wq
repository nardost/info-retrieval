Watched by crocodiles on the bank of a tropical Northern Territory stream; sitting in a peaceful desert water dreaming place; interpreting a significant rock art site; dancing and singing the country back to life - Aboriginal people from language groups across Australia share their words, wisdom and concern for the future of that crucial resource, water. It’s embedded in identity, culture, spirituality and survival. Brad Moggridge, a Murri from the Kamilaroi Nation, is a hydrogeologist who’s passionate about promoting Aboriginal ecological knowledge and he links the traditional with a contemporary scientific take on water management. In this, the driest inhabited continent on earth, understanding water has been essential for tens of thousands of years. Today, as Brad says, "Mobs all over the country still talk about water places, dream about water places, have law about water places and teach the next generation about water places. Water is a key part of who we are". Image: Water at Bermagui Yuin Country, Credit: BBC Show less
