New Australians Sharon Mascall's in Melbourne, where an attack on a 25-year old Indian student in May unleashed a wave of protest as well as accusations of racism and discrimination. She meets migrants who've crossed the globe from Africa, Europe and Asia, to make Australia their home. There's David Vincent, a former child soldier who's helping keep the peace among other Sudanese migrants, Esperance Kalonji, a tailor from the Democratic Republic of Congo who's changing the face of fashion in Brisbane and Rasoul Ahmady from Afghanistan and his team of Afghan refugees.
