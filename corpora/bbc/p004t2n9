Public Places, Private Lives is a series of portraits of well known places that reveal the lives and stories of those people who come to a famous spot not to gaze as tourists, but for work or for their own private reasons. The second programme is set in the Taj Mahal, where we hear the experiences of those people for whom one of the most important sites in India is part of their daily landscape. In some of the most well known and busy destinations in the world, Public Places, Private Lives encourages us to stop and stare for a moment. The longer you stay, and the closer you listen, the more is revealed about the lives, experiences and stories of their most regular visitors. Show less
