Jessica Cox was born without arms. But the 33-year-old from the American state of Arizona has never let that stand in the way of fulfilling her dreams. Her latest achievement is to become the world's first licensed pilot with no arms - a feat which has gained her a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. The Bulgarian artist Christo escaped the communist regime of his home country in 1957 aged 21, and travelled to Paris to pursue his career as an artist. It was there he met his future wife and artistic collaborator Jeanne-Claude. Their most famous artworks involve wrapping objects in fabric - from cans and bottles to whole buildings - including the Reichstag in Berlin, which took a team of over 200 people and 90 professional climbers to complete. Saba Qaiser is a young Pakistani woman whose father and uncle tried to kill her for marrying a man without their consent. She survived being shot and thrown in a river and now tells her story in a film by the award-winning Pakistani director Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy. The film A Girl in the River has been nominated for an Oscar. Yoshihiro Watanabe likes a challenge. He has just finished walking the length of Japan from the north to the south. It is a huge journey which has taken him over two years to complete. He did it dressed as a samurai warrior. Before that Yoshihiro walked across the USA from east to west. He decided to do these extreme walks in memory of an American woman, Rebecca Floyd, who had mentored him when he studied drama in the USA. (Photo: Jessica Cox in the cockpit.
