FAMILY LIFE RUNNING HOTELS Dr Julie Seymour recently published the findings of her new research study entitled Treating the Hotel Like a Home. Dr Seymour who grew up in a hotel in Clacton-on-Sea herself, discusses the accommodations that family life must make when living in and running a hotel. SLUM TRAVELLERS For upper class women of the two generations preceding World War I, the poorest parts of London exerted a magnetic pull. Thousands of women from the ‘best circles’, turned their backs on the season, balls, parties and picnics and headed for the slums; some of them living incognito with the poor to better understand their predicament. Laurie Taylor talks to Professor Ellen Ross, author of a new book Slum Travellers which explores these women’s experiences and the impact they had on attitudes to the poor. Joining the discussion is writer and journalist Polly Toynbee who went undercover amongst Britain’s low-paid workers to discover the realities of life on minimum wage. Show less
