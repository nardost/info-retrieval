Amaryllis Fox tells Jo Fidgen how she was head-hunted by two different spying agencies while studying at Oxford and Georgetown. She was recruited by the CIA aged 21 and within a few years she was an undercover field agent. Amaryllis lived under false identities, infiltrating arms dealing networks. She was pushed into getting married twice during her service so her partners could gain the necessary security clearance. She even had a baby which she took with her on secret missions. Amaryllis has written a book about her life as a spy called Life Undercover: Coming of Age in the CIA. Irina Nistor brought foreign cinema to communist Romania, she secretly dubbed bootlegged copies of Hollywood films which were banned by the Ceausescu regime. Last week, Rico Hizon and Sharanjit Leyl took Outlook on a tour of their city – Singapore – through the extraordinary stories of people who live there. Today we hear a reminder of some of the best moments. Picture: Amaryllis Fox Credit: Tristar Media Show less
