MAPI DE LAS HERAS Almost exactly 15 years ago, Fernando Mugica - a prominent Socialist politician from the Basque Country in northern Spain - was murdered in the street by a single bullet to the neck. He is one of hundreds of people who have died as a result of the violent struggle by the separatist group Eta to create an independent state. His widow Mapi de las Heras revisits the place where he was murdered. JAMES HART DYKE The British Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6, has been marking 100 years since it started its spying operations. For a secretive organisation it has chosen a decidedly public way of doing it - by commissioning an artist to spend a year undercover with its spies. Landscape painter James Hart Dyke got the job and his work is now on display in a gallery in London. PASTOR KIM HAE SUNG Kim Hae Sung is known as "the battered pastor" because of the beatings he says he's taken for defending migrant workers' rights in South Korea. He's dedicated his life to helping people who have no legal representation and little access to health or social care - often at the expense of his own safety. He tells Outlook's Jo Fidgen his story.
