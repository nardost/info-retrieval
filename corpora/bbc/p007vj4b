On Outlook with Matthew Bannister... The personal story of the British politician who's become the first Asian and first Muslim Cabinet minister in the UK. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi of Dewsbury has a number of firsts under her belt: she's the first Asian person to hold a full Cabinet post in the UK Government, the first Muslim to do so, and at age 36, was the first Muslim woman to sit on the front bench of a British political party. Now even around a new coalition Cabinet table of notable appointees Sayeeda Warsi stands out. Born in the old English mill town of Dewsbury, the 39 year-old describes herself as a "northern, working-class, urban, working-mum". She talks to Matthew Bannister about her family's humble beginnings in England, the racism she experienced campaigning in her hometown and what inspired her politically. She also describes the moment she was asked to become a Cabinet minister and the sacrifices involved in raising five children while doing a high level political job. Show less
