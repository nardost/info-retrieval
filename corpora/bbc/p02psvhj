The latest information from Nepal suggests that more than 5,000 people died in the huge earthquake that hit the country at the weekend, and nearly 8,000 were injured. But the headline casualty figures are only part of the story. Millions more have had their lives turned upside down - including journalist Bhrikuti Rai who was at her home in Kathmandu when the quake struck. She has been keeping a diary of the dramatic events. Forty years after the end of the Vietnam War, we hear from Anne Morrison whose husband was an American anti-war activist who set himself on fire in front of the White House in protest against the conflict. Alexis Wright is an Aboriginal land rights campaigner in Australia who has become a best selling novelist. In 2007 she was the first Aboriginal to win outright the country's most prestigious literary prize for her book Carpentaria. Her latest novel The Swan Book explores her aboriginal heritage and culture. Jacque Kahura is a remarkable primary school teacher from Kenya, who was a finalist in this year's Global Teachers' Prize. Jacque teaches 55 children at a school in the coastal town of Kilifi, but her work goes beyond the classroom. She has been speaking to Kim Chakanetsa of our sister programme The Conversation about her experiences. (Photo: A woman walks on rubble of collapsed buildings after the earthquake in Nepal.
