Gideon Coe and an audience of 150 people in central London put their questions to the singer and performer John Lydon, the former lead singer of The Sex Pistols. The programme explores John's return to live work as his group PIL reformed after a break of 20 years, with questions regarding his favourite places to play and the recent controversy surrounding his concerts in Israel. He also talks candidly about his reflections on the punk fashions of the seventies and his feeling about the death of Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren. John was not adverse to exploring the song writing process to some of his best known songs and revealed that his Sex Pistols anthem God Save The Queen, is often misunderstood and was not condemning the Royal Family but merely questioning their role. Through out the programme John Lydon is to the point, honest and very entertaining making this one of programme a revealing kind of music programme and one not to miss. So take your seats alongside presenter Gideon Coe and get to know one of contemporary musicâ€™s leading figures a little better in An Audience With John Lydon. (Image: John Lydon of the Sex Pistols.
