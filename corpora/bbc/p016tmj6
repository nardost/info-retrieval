This week on The Forum we explore something we all succumb to now and then: obsessive behaviour. It may be an infatuation with another person you canâ€™t get out of your head or a fixation on a single object or idea that, like a talisman, you are scared to let go of. But what is it that drives our obsessions? Joining Bridget Kendall are internet analyst and cyber-sceptic, Belarus -born Evgeny Morozov; leading Spanish novelist and translator, Javier Marias; and Indian-American mathematics professor and author, Manil Suri.
