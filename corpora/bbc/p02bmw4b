In August 2013 the Assad regime in Syria was accused of deploying chemical weapons against its own civilian population. The world looked on, horrified. In the United States President Obama – who had described the use of chemical weapons as a “red line” – was planning airstrikes against the Syrian government. In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron was determined to stand with him - but first he had to win Parliament’s approval. And the clock was ticking. Shaun Ley tells the inside story of one extraordinary day in the British House of Commons and a vote which changed history.
