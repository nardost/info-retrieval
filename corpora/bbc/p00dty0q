Mukul Devichand tells the story of Mohamed ElBaradei, the former Chief Weapons Inspector who some want to see as the next president of Egypt. The former lawyer and diplomat rose to international prominence as Head of the International Atomic Energy Authority, winning the Nobel Peace Prize along the way. His return to Egypt last year caused a flurry of excitement among pro-democracy campaigners who saw him as the best chance of a challenge to President Hosni Mubarak. Mr. ElBaradei has been more cautious about his own prospects - but could he now unite a fragmented opposition and ride the wave of protest to the very top? Mukul Devichand hears about the man behind the headlines, a shy person who relaxes with the comedy of Woody Allen and Seinfeld. Show less
