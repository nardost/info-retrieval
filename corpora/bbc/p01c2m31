Richard Rogers is one of a handful of architects who have made a great impact on cities across the globe. He built the Pompidou Centre in Paris, the Lloydâ€™s building in London, as well as the Millennium Dome. He built Terminal 4 in Madrid airport and is currently creating Tower 3 on the site of Ground Zero in New York. For many years he advised on city development in Barcelona as well as London. He has partnered with Renzo Piano and with Norman Foster, and with his excitingly technical machine-style buildings he has been spearheading hi-tech architecture worldwide. He is now Lord Rogers of Riverside and is garlanded with the highest honours and prizes that architecture can bestow. In a special event to celebrate his 80th birthday he discusses his vision for the future of our cities with Razia Iqbal and an audience at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.
