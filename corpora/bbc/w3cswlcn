Lou Conran is a British stand-up comedian who has made a career out of making fun of herself. But then something devastating happened to her, she had to give birth to a stillborn baby five months into the pregnancy. For a while she thought she might not be able to go on stage and make jokes any more. It wasn't a subject suited to comedy. But then Lou started thinking that maybe talking about it on stage would help both her and other women who've been through such an upsetting experience. Bob Hoffman loves collecting harmonicas, or mouth organs, or French harps, as they're sometimes called. And he especially loves the cases you keep them in. So much so that people call him 'Hoff the Harmonica Case Man'. Colm Flynn has been to see his record-breaking collection. Syrian chef Imad Alarnab had a small restaurant empire in Damascus, but when the conflict started in 2011 his life became hard and dangerous. Imad would use his cookery skills to help him survive what was to come. Image: Lou Conran Credit: Aemen Sukkar Show less
