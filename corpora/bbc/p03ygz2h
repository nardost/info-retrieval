Gustavo Castro Soto was with his friend, the Honduran environmental activist Berta Caceres, when she was shot dead on 2 March 2016 - just two days before her 45th birthday. Berta had been awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize in 2015 for her successful fight against the construction of a controversial hydro electric dam, which would have affected their traditional land. Gilad Millo has become a pop sensation in Kenya, singing in both English and Swahili. But a lot of his fans have been surprised to discover that he is actually an Israeli ex-diplomat in his mid-40s. When our reporter Andrea Kidd went to meet him in Nairobi, Gilad told her how he discovered that his first song Unajua had gone to number one. Another chance to hear an epic tale of survival, first broadcast four years ago. Juliane Koepcke is one of our Outlook Inspirations. Born to two German biologists, Juliane was brought up in Peru, close to the Amazon rainforest. At the age of 17, as she prepared to join her father for Christmas, her life changed forever. At 11 o'clock on 24 December 1971, she and her mother boarded the LANSA flight 508 from Lima to Puccalpa. But, 30 minutes after take-off, their plane flew into a heavy thunderstorm.
