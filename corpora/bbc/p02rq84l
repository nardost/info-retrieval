Claudia Taranto hears the powerful stories from people who travel overseas to find work, exploring the dramatic impact of temporary migrant labour on individuals and countries. Claudia travels to Australia where she hears how temporary workers are changing the face of a country founded on the idea of permanent settlement. She uncovers abuses of the temporary migrant visa system and speaks to a group of Filipino welders earning far less than they were promised in their contracts. Claudia also hears from critics who call for a return to a 'settler society.' (Photo: Filipino welders working in Australia. BBC copyright) Show less
