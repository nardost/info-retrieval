On Start the Week Andrew Marr discusses Spain's economic crisis, and the legacy of Franco. In the last decade Spain has begun to unearth some of the mass graves of the hundreds of thousands of people who were killed in the 1930s by both sides in the civil war. Paul Preston discusses what he calls the Spanish Holocaust and its impact on Spain today. Maria Delgado argues that the significance of Franco's reign transcends politics, and can be felt strongly in Spain's cultural landscape. The MEP Daniel Hannan sees the country's strong support for Europe as the legacy of repression following the civil war, but believes that its present financial crisis would be eased by rejecting the euro. While the economist Iain Begg discusses Spain's problems within the wider Eurozone and the effect of political changes in France and Greece. Producer: Katy Hickman. Show less
