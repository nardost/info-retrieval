Laurie Taylor talks to John Holmwood, Professor of Sociology at the University of Birmingham and author of a new book which argues against the notion that there was a plot to Islamicise schools in Birmingham. Instead, he considers the teachers and pupils are victims of a false narrative. They're joined by Sukhwant Dhaliwal, one of the founders and Editorial Collective members of a new journal on gender and fundamentalism called Feminist Dissent, who considers some of the claims have foundation and raises issues about the role of religion in our educational system.
