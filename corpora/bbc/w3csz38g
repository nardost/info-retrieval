The search for the lost music of Costa Rica's King of Calypso. Walter Ferguson spent many years serenading people with his songs, and recording individual cassettes for adoring fans, but they were often the only recordings of his work. Much later a music producer realised all those cassettes contained one-off musical treasures and so began an international campaign to find Walter's lost songs.
