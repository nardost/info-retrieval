A child's suicide and a father's campaign In India the caning of children is at the centre of a national debate following the suicide of 13-year-old Rouvanjit Rawla. He was a student at an elite school in Kolkata, where he had been caned before his death. His father Ajay blames this treatment for his son's suicide, but the school disputes this. Ajay tells Matthew about the impact of his son's suicide on all of his family.
