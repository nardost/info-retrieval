David McAlmont travels to San Francisco to tell the glittering and sad tale of gay black diva Sylvester James, famed for his disco hit Mighty Real. Sylvester's short life says much about U.S. civil rights movements, the politics of the American music business and the devastating effects of Aids. David talks to Sylvester's sister, friends and fellow performers, and visits the San Francisco Opera House, where Sylvester recorded his renowned live album Living Proof. (Photo: Sylvester James.
