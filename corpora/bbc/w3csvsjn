Houston is one of the world’s largest refugee cities – the largest in the US. It also has a large Latino population – many documented, some not. It has an extraordinarily diverse set of different communities and a lot of political tension. Most of Texas, and almost half of Houston, voted for Donald Trump. Because of the refugee issue, Houston airport was one of the main flashpoints of the crisis sparked by his 'Muslim Ban' earlier in the year. ICE, the immigration enforcement wing of federal government, has stepped up raids and promised a crackdown on undocumented immigrants. Those who do have legal status fear becoming collateral damage in that crackdown. One protection that has existed for some time for younger immigrants brought to the US as children, the DACA, is being threatened by President Trump’s government, helping further cement the feeling that government is setting itself against this community. But in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, refugees and undocumented immigrants, already scared about deportation and the risks of interacting with government, must seek help from the same authorities they fear might seek to look into their immigration status. As Houston comes together, the city’s mosques and Islamic centres have opened their doors to all who need shelter. Volunteers from all backgrounds have been helping those who need rescue and immediate relief. For a brief moment, prejudices seem to melt away. But can it last through what will be a long process of rebuilding? (Photo: People use boats to help bring items out of homes after flooding caused by storm Harvey, 2017.
