An international NGO, Women without Borders, based in Vienna, with years of experience working in the field of counter terrorism, is pioneering a strategy of using mothers of Jihadist fighters and supporters to help counter the radicalisation of young men and women. Razia Iqbal went to Austria to meet some of the mothers, brought together for the first time.
