This year's Reith lecturer is the Booker prize-nominated author Marina Warner. A writer of fiction, criticism and history, her works include novels and short stories as well as studies of art, myths, symbols, and fairytales. Her series of Reith Lectures entitled 'Managing Monsters' explore how myths express and shape our attitudes. In her final Reith Lecture, Marina Warner looks at the relationship between myths of national identity and the home, and argues that at the heart of nationalism lies the interdependency of home, identity, heritage and women, and that this mythology of the hearth continues to flourish in the present nationalist revival.
