Smart and eco-cities are design buzz-words â€“ but how realistic are such plans globally? This week Bridget Kendall takes a future city tour with South African urban planning professor Vanessa Watson, who says plans to transform sub-Saharan African cities into gleaming Dubai-style hubs are harmful fantasies. Also, Delhi resident and writer Rana Dasgupta explains how he has watched his adopted city utterly transform in the last 20 years. And, futurologist Josef Hargrave offers a vision of an urban super-building in 2050. (Photo: A model of a proposed development in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Credit: AFP/ Getty Images) Show less
