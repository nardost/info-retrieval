It's 60 years since Edmund Hillary and Tensing Norgay became the first men to set foot on the summit of the world's highest mountain, Everest. Today on Outlook we speak to Peter Hillary, the son of Edmund. We talk to him about his own amazing adventures; what it's like to be the son of a hero; and how his family works to improve life for ordinary people in Nepal. Also on Outlook we hear from Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, a South African clinical psychologist who tried to understand one of her country's most notorious figures. Nicknamed "Prime Evil", his real name is Eugene De Kock, and he used to be a police chief in South Africa. He's in prison and has been convicted of 89 charges of kidnap, torture and murder of activists. Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela wrote a book based on her interviews with him, which has now been turned into a play.
