Will Hutton joins Anne McElvoy for a programme focusing on economics and wealth in Britain. We're used to hearing about the state of the economy, but what about the discipline of economics itself? Anne McElvoy is joined by three leading practitioners to discuss the latest developments in the field, and what they can tell us about the world today. Will Hutton's new book offers a diagnosis of where we are now and offers suggestions about where we should go next. Wendy Carlin is Professor of Economics and Macroeconomics at UCL, and claims it's time for a thorough overhaul of the way her subject is taught. Richard Davies is Economics Editor at The Economist, and has studied how new ideas in economics are being made to work for business. Luke Johnson is the Chairman of Risk Capital Partners and the former Chairman of Channel 4 Television. He is an entrepreneur who argues it's risk, not textbooks, that keeps the economy going. They'll discuss the state of economics today, from the seminar room to the trading floor. Producer: Luke Mulhall Editor: Robyn Read. Show less
