Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, Berliner Irmela Mensah-Schramm tells Jo Fidgen why she has made it her mission to clear the city of neo-Nazi propaganda. Every day the 66-year-old goes out with her metal scraper and a can of spray paint to photograph, then destroy, any slogans with a far-right message. Also today, the British woman who suffered a heart attack in her thirties - and was left without a memory. And, the blind climber from Austria who's determined to scale the world's highest summits.
