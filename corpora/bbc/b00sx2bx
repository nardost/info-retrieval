Start The Week pits rational optimism against humane pessimism as Andrew Marr brings together the philosopher Roger Scruton, who argues against the dangers of false hope, and the former chairman of Northern Rock, Matt Ridley, who views the world in a much more rosy light. The historian Peter Hennessy delves behind the country's national security strategy to explore the Secret State, while Linda Colley asks when did Britain's constitution become unwritten.
