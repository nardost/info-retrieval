On the 28th January 1986 Richard Scobee and millions others watched as his father Commander Dick Scobee led a team of people on the Space Shuttle Challenger that was bound for space . It was an exciting and proud moment for Richard but just 73 seconds after lift-off, it was clear something was wrong. The Challenger exploded in mid-air, killing all seven of its crew, including Richard’s dad. It was one of the most shocking disasters in the history of US space exploration and affected Richard Scobee for the rest of his life. Mubashir Saddique is from a small village in northern Pakistan, and he’s become something of an unlikely online hit in the country. A former football factory worker turned food enthusiast, he's been filming himself whipping up various Pakistani staples. He's the ultimate amateur home cook who does everything from scratch, all his vegetables are from his garden and he even mills his own flour. Robert Szucs is a Hungarian map-maker who calls himself the 'Grasshopper Geographer'. He was so bored with the maps he saw in his textbooks that he decided to create his own. Instead of charting cities and countries, he mapped all the waterways and river basins of the world using psychedelic rainbow colours.
