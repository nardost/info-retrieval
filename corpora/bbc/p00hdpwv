Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, a month after the death of legendary musician Gil Scott-Heron, we find out how he transformed the life of a young British man. Abdul Malik Al Nasir, who was known as Mark T Watson until he converted to Islam, had a troubled childhood. He was bullied at school for being mixed race and lived under brutally strict conditions in care homes from the age of nine. Malik says he was a "semi-illiterate street kid". However, a chance meeting with Gil Scott-Heron, back-stage at one of his concerts, changed Malik's life forever and took him to places he would never have dreamt of going. Abdul Malik al Nasir has published a book of poems under his original name Mark T Watson. The book is called Ordinary Guy, and is published by Fore-word Press Ltd. Show less
