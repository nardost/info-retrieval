Matthew Bannister talks to Fartuun Adan, a human rights activist in her homeland of Somalia. She's been honoured by America's First Lady and recognised as a Woman of Courage. She talks about her husband's assassination, bringing up her daughters, and helping former child soldiers as well as women who've been raped or forced into marriage. Also Chris Morgan Jones - he used to be a spy but now writes novels based on his experiences around the world. The Australian painter, Ben Quilty, explores why people join the army. And we delve into the BBC archive to mark 100 years of Igor Stravinsky's radical ballet, The Rite of Spring .
