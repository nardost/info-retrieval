Jane Little on: Virginia Masters, one half of the team that made sex the subject of everyday conversation - and mentionable on Radio 4. The archaeologist Mike Morwood whose discovery of a tiny skeleton in a cave helped transform our understanding of human evolution. John Casablancas, modelling agent and creator of the "supermodel" - who later said he regretted it. Sonia Moriceau, meditation teacher and champion table tennis player.
