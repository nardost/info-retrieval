Could meteorites explain the origin of life? Experiments with chemicals which existed before life began could hold the key to the first self replicating molecule, however the chemicals that helped it do so, probably came from a meteorite. Also in the programme, a big boost for the world's biggest particle accelerator looking to find the origin of mass and a controversial new theory on how we smell. Presenter: Martin Redfern. Show less
