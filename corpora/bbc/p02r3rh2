In Haiti, it's very common for children, particularly from rural areas, to be sent to live with host families so they can go to school. They're called restavek children - from the French for 'stay with'. It's thought there are maybe up to 300,000 children in this situation, but many of them end up being treated like slaves. Adeline Bien-Aimé was herself sent to live with relatives as a girl, and works for the Restavek Freedom Foundation in Port-au-Prince for other children who've escaped the system. Also on today's Outlook: Postcard from Yemen - Ahlam in Aden talks about how months of war have affected her and her family - and how she had no choice but to let her sister die in front of her.
