In Iran, It is not just former President Ahmadinejad who slams homosexuals, many people also deny homosexuality or know very little about it. So how does one family cope when they realise their daughter is gay? This is not the usual story of mistreating gay people in countries like Iran. It is not about rejection, nor brutality, towards a young girl. This is about the collective struggle of a supportive and close-knit family – who are trying to find a solution for this "crisis", each in their own way. Denial, anger, disappointment and silence are some of the reactions to the undeniable fact that she is gay. After the reluctant acceptance, they are looking for a way out. But what role will religion, culture and family affections play in this struggle within the boundaries of home? Leyla Khodabakhshi will take you through this family journey to show the suffering of both sides – for the daughter and the rest of the family.
