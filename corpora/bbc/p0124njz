Jo Fidgen is in Lapland for Outlook - she's in the company of hunters and herders to find out what it takes to survive the sub-zero temperatures of Northern Sweden. The mountains and forests teem with bears, wolverines and the reindeer which have provided the Sami people with food for thousands of years. Jan Ejeklint takes her dog sledding in the search for capercaillie, a bird special to the region. And Karin Vasara describes her nomadic childhood and how she has rediscovered her culture through making clothes from reindeer skin.
