Personal stories behind the news from all over the world. With Lucy Ash. Rwandan forgiveness; Beautiful Camels; Oran Canfield Rwandan Forgiveness Former leading Rwandan politician Joseph Sebarenzi's whole life has been scarred by violence. Most of his family were killed during the country's 1994 genocide, but today he tells us why he's chosen to forgive rather than to hate. He's called his memoir "God Sleeps in Rwanda". Camel Beauty Contest The BBC's Dawood Azami takes us to a beauty pageant with a difference. Twenty-eight thousand camels lined up at the annual Al-Dhafra Festival in Abu Dhabi recently. Dawood meets some of the owners who hoped their camel would be named the cutest and pick up the millions of dollars in prize money given to the winner. Oran Canfield Despite being the son of a self-help guru, American musician Oran Canfield explains why he has spent much of own life seeking help. He tells us about a dysfunctional childhood and battles against drug addiction which he's written up in the book 'Freefall: The Strange True Life Growing Up Adventures of Oran Canfield'. Show less
