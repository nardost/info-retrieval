NASA astronauts Mark and Scott Kelly are the only twins who have both flown into space. They share the exhilaration of re-entering the earth's atmosphere, and remember the trauma of the 2011 gun attack on Mark's wife Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. From Islamabad, we hear the story of Mohammed Ayub, who has been teaching street children in a city park for nearly thirty years. Lory del Santo is an ex-Miss Universe contestant and former partner of Eric Clapton. The couple had a son, Conor, who died aged 4 in a tragic accident, falling from the window of their New York apartment. It inspired a song by Eric Clapton. Now Lory is working on a film about her life and how she's coped with her son's death. Francesco Sauro is an Italian caver who loves to burrow thousands of feet below the earth's surface. He has explored caves all over the world, and even helps to train astronauts for the European Space Agency. Turkish pianist Idil Biret was a child prodigy in the 1940s and an international soloist by the age of sixteen. She shares memories with the BBC's Nicki Paxman.
