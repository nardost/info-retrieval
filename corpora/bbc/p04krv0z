Saroo Brierley started life in India, fell asleep on a train at the age of five and ended up being adopted in Australia. He was 'a little boy lost' who didn't even know the name of his hometown. But 25 years later he found his birth family again by zooming in on internet maps, matching landmarks with those from his childhood memories. In June 2009 a plane travelling from Yemen crashed into the Indian ocean just a few miles from its destination. Bahia Bakari was 13 years old at the time and was the sole survivor of the tragic incident which claimed the lives of the other 152 people on board. Viju Lakshman Chavan gave birth to her daughter during the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks as a gunfight raged in the corridors of the hospital. 166 people died during the attacks and her daughter Goli, whose name means 'bullet', became a symbol of new life for the battered city.
