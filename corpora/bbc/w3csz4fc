The internet of things, devices that communicate with each other across networks are becoming increasingly part of everyday life – controlling the heating systems in our houses, or entertainment provided by voice activated assistants. What is the potential, and what are the potential pitfalls, of living in this world of ‘things’ which talk to each other, as well as to us? Are we just beginning to understand the broader implications of what happens when the ‘things’ start to talk? Philip Moynagh has enjoyed an insider’s perspective of what the future might look like – as a vice president at the micro-processor manufacturer Intel. His responsibilities in the company’s Internet of Things group meant he spent a lot of time thinking about future applications of the company’s technology. So he was exposed to applications of technology inside the company before such applications became commonplace in the outside world. Philip reflects on how his views of the internet of things have developed since leaving Intel and provides a knowledgeable and entertaining guide to a future that’s happening all around us today.
