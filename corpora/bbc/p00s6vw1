Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. In this episode, animal trainer Mark Dumas tells Matthew Bannister what it's like to live with a polar bear at the bottom of the garden. Her name is Agee and she's now 17 years old. Not only does she have her own swimming pool but she's a bit of a movie star as well. We also hear an interview with the man who was sentenced to death for refusing to fight for the Nazis during the war but now - aged ninety - campaigns on behalf of other German deserters. And on a satellite link, an interview with the Sardinian chef who prepares five-course meals for scientists on the Concordia Base in the Antarctic. He discusses the particular challenges of preparing food in a climate of minus 73 degrees. (Image: Mark Dumas and Agee relaxing. Credit: Beyond Bears) Show less
