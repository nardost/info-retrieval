Mamun Ahmed was one of the volunteer rescuers who helped save people from the Rana Plaza factory disaster in Bangladesh. He tells Pooneh Ghoddoosi about the profound emotional impact that the experience has had on him. Also on the programme: British woman Lara Prior-Palmer, the winner 1000km Mongol Derby which is the longest horse race in the world, talks about wild horses, Mongolian food and dangerous falls. Somali-born writer Nadifa Mohamed talks about her new book The Orchard of Lost Souls. We hear how her family fled Somalia for the UK in 1986 when she was four, but they left behind many relatives whose stories inspired her to write this novel. We also hear from 18-year-old Gabrielle Turnquest who is the youngest person in more than 600 years to become a qualified barrister in England and Wales.
