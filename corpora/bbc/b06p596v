"By 2029 computers will have emotional intelligence and be as convincing as people". Ray Kurzweil, Google's Director of Engineering, predicts this scenario - also explored in Channel 4's hit drama, Humans. So what are the skills needed for the 21st-century workplace and do humans have them? According to Paul Mason, TV journalist and author of PostCapitalism, we face seismic change in part due to the revolution in information technology. Paul Mason joins Lucy Armstrong, Chief Executive of The Alchemists - who help companies grow - and Richard and Daniel Susskind, authors of The Future of the Professions, who argue we will no longer need doctors, lawyers, accountants, teachers and others to work as they did in the 20th century. Chaired by Free Thinking presenter Rana Mitter in front of an audience at the Free Thinking Festival at Sage Gateshead and first broadcast in November 2015. Producer: Luke Mulhall. Show less
