Wind is all around us, on earth, on the high seas and in a different form, out in space - a powerful force which shapes our environment, and which increasingly we are trying to tame and harness. It is also the stuff or myth and legend around the World. With Bridget Kendall to explore some aspects of wind, Dr Max Platzer, the distinguished aerospace engineer, once involved in Nasa’s iconic space launches, who is now focused on how to harvest energy from the powerful winds of the world’s oceans using a massive fleet of sailing ships with the ability to convert wind energy into hydrogen. Earth and space meteorologist professor Chris Scott from Reading University in the UK tracks the solar winds which come to us from space, to probe how they affect us on earth and has new research linking wind with lightening. And, from Boston in the USA, artist Nathalie Miebach weaves extraordinary sculptures and musical compositions out of storm data she takes from weather stations.
