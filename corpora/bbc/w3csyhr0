In 2010, 25-year-old Dinesh Palipana was a medical student in Australia. One night, while he was driving back from visiting his parents, he got involved in a car crash that would change his life. The accident left him quadriplegic: he lost the use of his arms and legs. But that didn't stop him from becoming an emergency doctor. The Shiant Isles are three islands that make up part of the Outer Hebrides - an archipelago of more than 100 islands off the north-west coast of Scotland. The Shiants are tiny, uninhabited islands, very wild and very beautiful. They used to belong to a man called Adam Nicolson. He inherited them from his father when he was 21....rather an unusual inheritance, but Adam says they have taught him a lot about life and love. Adam wrote a book about the islands called Sea Room: An Island Life. Image: Profile picture of Dr Dinesh Palipana Credit: Griffith University Show less
