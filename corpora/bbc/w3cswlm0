In 1967 Bob Connor, a sergeant with the U.S. Air Force, flew out to Vietnam to join the many American soldiers based there. He saw action in some of the most challenging battles of the war. Fifty years later, back in the US, Bob's granddaughter asked him to help her with a school history project. And so began Bob's journey back to Vietnam to help relatives find the graves of their loved ones. Mohammed Al Masri, or Mo, captains a boat giving guided canal tours in Amsterdam. He treats his passengers to detailed explanations of the city's immigrant history and the current migrant crisis. He is a good fit for this, as is his vessel. Mo is Syrian and made the treacherous journey from Turkey to Greece via a smuggler's boat in 2015. The boat he uses for the tours comes from Lampedusa and once carried migrants across the Mediterranean from north Africa. This is all part of a volunteer project called Rederij Lampedusa. Outlook's Katy Sherriff went to meet Mo on board his boat. Would you hire someone to impersonate one of your relatives? Yuichi Ishii is a former actor who runs Family Romance, a 'family rental' business in Japan. He pretends to be people's fathers, husbands and ex-lovers. Over nine years, he's played spouse to a hundred women and organised 8,000 fake weddings. But, it's an ethical minefield when you're living a lie. He spoke to Outlook's Saskia Edwards about it.
