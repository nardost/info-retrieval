Trevor Noah has had a remarkable journey from the poor Soweto township he grew up in to hosting one of America's best loved late-night show's, the Daily Show. He was born during apartheid in South Africa and the laws said black and white people couldn't be in a sexual relationship together, but Trevor's mum broke those rules and had him with a white father. Even though he lives in New York Trevor is still deeply committed to South Africa and recently launched the Trevor Noah Foundation to help orphans and vulnerable children. In the beautiful setting of Brooklyn Academy of Music, Joe Pascal meets the multi-talented Bacon Brothers. Kevin Bacon is an award-winning actor who has starred in over seventy films including "Footloose", "A Few Good Men" and "Apollo 13", but he's also an accomplished musician with an amazing singing voice who writes his own songs and plays several instruments. His love of music is shared with his big brother Michael - a talented singer-songwriter, who has won numerous awards for his film and TV compositions. The two brothers have been playing together since they were boys and sharing a stage for 25 years. Performing some of their latest songs in front of a live audience, Kevin and Michael tell Joe about their extraordinary lives and why music has created such an enduring bond between them.
