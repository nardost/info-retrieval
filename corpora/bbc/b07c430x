Matthew Sweet joins curator Katy Barron and three photographers, Wolfgang Suschitzky, Dorothy Bohm and Neil Libbert, all now over 75, to explore a show that offers an account of the twentieth century seen through their eyes. Still image then gives way to the moving image as Matthew considers what the much heralded new Carry On film may have to offer and what the original films tell us about the historical and social context from which they emerged. To ponder both the old and the new in Carry Ons he's joined by actress Jacki Piper, film historian Graham McCann and screenwriter David McGillivray. And author and former editor of the Catholic Herald Peter Stanford considers the role of relics as a bone fragment believed to come from St Thomas Becket travels from Hungary to be displayed at Canterbury.

Plans have been announced at Cannes to make a series of new films. The fragment of bone is the centrepiece of a week-long pilgrimage in London and Kent.
