When Carmen Aguirre was just 13 years old she was assaulted by a stranger in the woods near her home. It was during the summer of 1981 and the man was known as the 'paper bag rapist'. John Horace Oughton earned this grim nickname because he was known to cover children's heads with paper bags to prevent them identifying him. For Carmen it was an experience that affected her deeply. 33 years after it happened she took the decision to meet the man face-to-face in prison. Andre Bauma is a ranger at the Virunga National Park which is home to around a quarter of the world's mountain gorillas, a critically endangered species. He told Matthew Bannister how he first came to adopt a newborn gorilla. Kasiva Mutua is one of the top drummers in Kenya - impressive in a country where drumming was viewed by many as a male preserve. Kasiva's been inspired by the stories, culture and sounds of her native country. (Picture: Carmen Aguirre. Photo credit Adrian Cook.) Show less
