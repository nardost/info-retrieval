Radhika Hettiarachchi tells us why she felt compelled to document the lives of women in Sri Lanka and record their stories of war, tsunami and loss. The American musician, Rodriguez, recalls his feelings when his career stalled after early success in the 1970s. He disappeared from the public eye and was even rumoured to have died - before he was discovered alive and well in Detroit. We meet the silver surfers in the Brazilian port city of Santos, who describe the joys of riding the waves in their 70s and 80s. And the man in Philadelphia who makes a living as a Rocky impersonator. (Picture: A Sri Lankan mother holds photographs of two soldier sons she lost in the civil war.
