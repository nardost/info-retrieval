Like a lot of little boys, RG Williams loved buses. In the 1980s he would ride on one every day to school in Louisville, Kentucky. Those journeys would change his life, taking him out of the poor area he lived in and filling him with hope for the future. Joy Milne is a nurse from Scotland who has an extraordinary sense of smell which has been causing a lot of excitement among researchers of the disease Parkinson's. Joy says she can smell the disease on those diagnosed with Parkinson's something which researchers think may lead to a medical breakthrough. Jose Alberto Gutierrez is a rubbish collector from Colombia who has a rather interesting collection of books. He's rescued thirty thousand of them from the trash cans of Bogota and he's created a special library for the local children. Dimitri O'Donnell has been to meet Jose and some of his customers.
