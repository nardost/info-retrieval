Kasha Nabagesera has faced violence and discrimination in Uganda for being gay. She has never hidden the fact that she's a lesbian despite the fact that it is illegal to be a practising homosexual in Uganda. We also visit the Phare Ponleu Selpak circus school in Cambodia. The school was set up by Khuon Det, in order to help himself and others to recover from the devastation left by the Khmer Rouge. And the twenty-six year old woman who swapped her life in Los Angeles and her job at NASA for a job in a bookshop in Scotland. Picture: Kasha Nabagesera Show less
