Three years ago Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 departed from Kuala Lumpur International Airport with 239 people on board. It was due to arrive in Beijing a few hours later, but contact with the plane was lost less than an hour after take-off and neither it, nor any of its passengers have been seen since. For K S Narendran - known as Naren - this was devastating news. His wife was on board flight MH370 and Naren has spent the last three years trying to get some answers about what happened to the plane. He's now a spokesperson for the families of the missing passengers. Irishman Gavan Hennigan was once a heroin addict, but now he takes on extreme adventures. The latest was rowing solo across the Atlantic. Gavan became the fastest solo competitor in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge, which is known as the world's toughest row. It's a 3,000-mile journey from the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa to Antigua in the West Indies. And this is not his first race - he's taken part in countless adventures, including racing on foot across the Arctic. Miki Sudo is one of the few women who take part in the quintessentially American activity of competitive eating. She's the top woman in the sport and is ranked fourth in the world overall. Last month, she faced the challenge of eating as many bowls of chili as possible in six minutes in Orlando, Florida. Outlook's Renata Sago went along to find out how it's done.
