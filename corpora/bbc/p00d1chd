THE ANGEL OF EDGWARE ROAD On July 7th 2005 suicide bombers set off explosions on the crowded London transport system that killed 52 people and injured more than 700. The underground train that British teacher Tim Coulson was travelling on was in a tunnel near Edgware Road station passing another train carrying the bomber Mohammed Siddique Khan when he exploded his device. As the trains were plunged into darkness there was panic. But, instead of looking after himself, Tim risked his own life to help the people who were dying or injured in the huge explosion. He still suffers from the traumatic aftereffects of what he saw and has had to give up his job. But he's been given awards for his bravery and some call him "the Angel of Edgware Road". Talking to Matthew Bannister he relives the events of that day. Show less
