Teacher and principal Tim King was working in a school in Chicago when he met a student named Keith. Their relationship changed when Keith’s mother died after struggling with drug addiction and Tim knew he had to help. Eventually Keith moved in with Tim and although it wasn’t always smooth sailing, Keith finally got the chance to be a kid and Tim learnt how to be a dad. Today, they work together running schools to give other disadvantaged young people an education. Francisco Correa is the man striving to keep the whistling language of Silbo alive on La Gomera, a Canary Island. The language has been part of the island’s culture and has been used for generations to communicate across distances of up to 5km. On the Isle of Man, off the north-west coast of England, father-daughter team Peter and Lavinia Washington spend their free time volunteering at sea. Together they work with the lifeboat service. They’re on call 24/7 ready to rescue people who’ve got into trouble at sea. Photo: Teacher Tim King Credit: Courtesy of Urban Prep Academies Show less
