Nepalese Laxman Ranjit is known as a demon dancer. He stopped performing after his wife died in an earthquake in Kathmandu but he has now started dancing again with his son. They're called nonna in Italy, babushka in Russia, and sobo in Japan. In South Africa, grandmothers are known as gogos. There's a group of gogos in Johannesburg who are overcoming stereotypes with their boxing group. Outlook's Mpho Lakaje went to meet them. Mickey Wilson is an American slackliner. It's a sport a bit like tightrope walking, except that instead of a rope or a wire, you walk across flat webbing which stretches and bounces like a trampoline. When one of his friends was almost strangled by his own rucksack while on a chair-lift at a skiing resort, Mickey used his slacklining skills to save the day (Picture credit: Prakash Mathema/AFP/Getty Images.)
