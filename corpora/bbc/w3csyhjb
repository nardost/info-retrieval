Justin Finlayson is on a mission to save lives. He converted his double-decker London bus into a music studio and drove it between areas where there were gangs – encouraging the young people caught up in the violence or at risk from it, to make music together. When we spoke to him a year ago, his son had been stabbed over ten times – luckily he survived, but then Justin’s bus was burned to the ground. Undaunted, Justin tells Jo Fidgen how he's managed to raise the funds for a new bus and why he’s now offering yoga and kickboxing to young people as well as music, to help keep them out of trouble. His charity is called United Borders. In 1986 American teenager, Jeff Henigson was diagnosed with brain cancer and given two years left to live. He had just one wish: to travel to the Soviet Union, meet the country's leader Mikhail Gorbachev and attempt to broker a nuclear peace deal. He spoke to Outlook's Asya Fouks. Jeff has written a book about his experience called WarHead. Image: Justin Finlayson in front of the new double-decker bus he turned into a music studio Credit: United Borders Show less
