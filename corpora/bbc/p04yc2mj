Syria is home to some of the world's most significant archaeological sites, but during years of conflict lots of them have been looted or even destroyed. Isber Sabrine is a former tour guide from the country and has set up a network of volunteers to document Syria's lost priceless antiquities. We meet the people behind Hombres Tejedores, a group of men in the Chilean capital Santiago, with a passion for colourful knitting. They are trying to break down the barriers that say knitting is just for women. Cara Brookins and her children built their five-bedroom house by themselves and with no previous experience of construction work. They did it to rebuild their lives after the trauma of Cara's three failed marriages. Malavath Pruna is the youngest female to reach the summit of Mount Everest at just 13-years-old. Her story is now being made into a Bollywood film. (Photo: Isber Sabrine courtesy of Isber Sabrine) Show less
