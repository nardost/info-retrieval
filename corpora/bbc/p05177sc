Fatuma Abdulkadir Adan grew up in the Marsabit area of Northern Kenya. Most of the families there are nomadic farmers who raise cattle and there has been a history of violent conflict between the different tribes in the area as they have competed for the best pasture land and water for their animals. Fatuma wanted to bring peace to her community, and one day she came up with an idea - get people to play football instead. She tells Matthew Bannister all about it. Q May Chen is a twenty-eight year old Taiwanese woman who has always dreamt about her wedding day, but thought that was something for later. Four years ago she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which has now spread to her bones and is terminal. Despite her prognosis and not having a groom, Q May Chen wanted to make her wedding dream a reality and she's been telling Cindy Sui how she made it happen. Brenda Berkman is a pioneering female firefighter in New York City, where women make up just half a per cent of the city's firefighters. It's a small figure, but not that long ago, women were not even allowed to apply for the job. Brenda was determined to join the ranks. Colm Flynn met her, and found out about the extraordinary discrimination she had to overcome. The city of Karachi in Pakistan is home to some 20 million people who between them generate 9,000 tonnes of waste each day and garbage collectors cannot keep up. But one woman, Nargis Latif, has developed a new and sustainable way to combat the problem. (Photo: Fatuma Adan flying a Kenyan flag courtesy of Fatuma) Show less
