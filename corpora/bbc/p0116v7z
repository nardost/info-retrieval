Pussy Riot member Yekaterina Samutsevich tells Matthew Bannister how her conservative family background turned her into a protester. Yekaterina was one of three members of the Russian punk rock band convicted of hooliganism in a trial that caused an international outcry. She was released in October with a suspended sentence. Also Kelvin Doe, the 16 year old from Sierra Leone who's built his own radio station out of garbage. His talents took him to one of the world's most prestigious universities - the Massachussetts Institute of Technology in Boston, USA. Then we hear from someone who's made the opposite journey from Kelvin. Robbie Hoskins is an American rapper who's making a new life for himself in a South African township.
