Three stories about people - in Washington DC, London and Kashmir - looking for a way out of a desperate situation. Pastor Lorraine Jones runs a boxing gym in south London that keeps young people safe from the clutches of violent gangs. She does it in the name of her son Dwayne who fell victim to gang violence himself. Zahid Shah from Srinigar in Indian-administered Kashmir lives for Parkour, a kind of street gymnastics involving backflips, handstands and somersaults. He says Parkour provides him with an escape from the stresses of living in a region beset by riots and political unrest. Rodney Stotts from Washington D.C. started dealing drugs in his teens. He says he expected his future to be either a life in prison or an early death. Then an encounter with a bird of prey changed everything for him. Credit: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Show less
