TARTAN A favourite of punk and the Christmas garb of the Windsors, a textile of tradition and a radical rebellious symbol, from the Jacobites to the Bay City Rollers, Tartan has developed into an extraordinarily potent weave. Is it an invented tradition? How did it garner such seemingly contradictory associations? Laurie Taylor is joined by Jonathan Faiers, Senior Lecturer at Central St Martins College of Art & Design and the author of a new book entitled Tartan; and Murray Pittock, A. C. Bradley Professor of Literature at the University of Glasgow to discuss the cultural and political history of tartan. DOG OWNERSHIP Social psychologist Sarah Knight co-author of a paper entitled In the Company of Wolves discusses the findings of her research on the physical, social and psychological benefits of dog ownership.
