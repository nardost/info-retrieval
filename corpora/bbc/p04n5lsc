American flatmates Dan Futrell and Isaac Stoner decided to try and solve a 30-year-old mystery in Bolivia - why Eastern Airlines Flight 980 crashed into the mountainside on the approach to La Paz airport on New Year's Day 1985. At 74, Meena Raghavan is the oldest known practitioner of an ancient martial art called Kalaripayattu, or Kalari. It's unusual for women to continue fighting past 14-years-old, but she carried on and today she's proud to run a fight school in India for boys, girls, men and women alike. Giovanni Monchiero is part of a truffle-hunting dynasty in Italy where he runs an extraordinary school for dogs - training them how to hunt the much-sought after and expensive delicacy. Outlook's Dany Mitzman went hunting with Giovanni and some of his students. Darren Cheewah is one of the few artists to emerge from the small Chinese community on the Caribbean island of Trinidad. He's a designer, satirist, tattooist - but he's best known for his colourful murals in the island's capital Port of Spain. The BBC's Nicki Paxman went to meet him.
