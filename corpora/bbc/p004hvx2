Personal stories behind the news from all over the world. With Lucy Ash. Health insurance whistleblower; Bosnia tourism; children of Mumbai's prostitutes. Wendell Potter Lucy Ash speaks to the once high flying American health insurance executive, Wendell Potter, who wants to blow the lid on what he says are the dishonest practices of the industry - where profits are valued over people. Bosnia tourism Vlado Simic combines his day job monitoring television and radio frequencies with exploring the tourism potential of his country, Bosnia-Herzegovina. He shares with us some of his favourite places, and says outsiders should forget the war of fifteen years ago, and come to see for themselves. Priti Pravin Patkar Award winning Priti Pravin Paktar tells Lucy Ash about her life long mission to save the children of Mumbai's prostitutes from having the same fate as their mothers. Show less
