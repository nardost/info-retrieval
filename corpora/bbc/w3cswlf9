Boxer Michael Bentt never wanted to fight, but he managed to climb to the top of his profession. He became the heavyweight champion of the world in 1993. And that was just the beginning of his remarkable journey. Mexican painter Manuel Solano has been seen in big galleries around the world. But the artist doesn't ever get to 'see' the paintings in a way most people would understand. That's because Manuel is legally blind. So how does a person paint, when they can't see the canvas? Winchman Kate Willougbhy tells the story of the dramatic rescue of Ben the dog. He was stuck on the top of a Scottish mountain during a wild storm.
