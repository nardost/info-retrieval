Last Broadcast Date: Mon 21 Aug 2017
The years leading up to partition was a time in which many Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus recalled living together harmoniously. We hear about the calls for independence; the rising clamour for an independent Pakistan; the dread as communal rioting gripped ever more of the sub-continent; how the movement of people began prior to independence; and how independence day was marked on both sides of the border. Producers: Michael Gallagher, Tim Smith and Ant Adeane (Photo: Living under the shadow of division: Those telling their stories of British Indiaâ€™s violent partition speak with remarkable clarity about the tumultuous events.
