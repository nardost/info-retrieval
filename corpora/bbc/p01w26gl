Mark Mardell presents three unexpected stories about how guns feature in American culture. More gun deaths are due to suicide than homicide in the US. Radio producers Kelly Jones and Lu Olkowski explore the legacy of one such suicide – what happened to the fiancée left behind, to friends and to the law enforcement officers involved. What happened to the gun itself? Radio and multimedia producers Dmae Roberts and Skye Fitzgerald venture across Oregon in the wake of the Clackamas mall shooting, and hear from people about their fear of violence, rational or not, that drives the fierce opposition to gun control. Ruxandra Guidi, another seasoned radio reporter, looks at the the lives of two mothers inextricably linked by gun violence in Denver.
