As part of the BBC World Service’s Crossing Divides season, Outlook is looking back at some extraordinary personal stories of transcending boundaries and crossing divides. Latifa Ibn Ziaten, a Moroccan mother to five has been awarded the highest honour in France, the Legion of Honour, and has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. Latifa's son, a French soldier, was murdered in Toulouse in 2012. Since then, Latifa has reached out to her ‘enemy’, working closely with people at risk of radicalisation in prisons and schools, and has convinced at least three young men not to go and fight in Syria. She spoke to Jo Fidgen. South African top model Refilwe Modiselle has spent her life walking the line between divides because she has albinism. She tells Outlook's Mpho Lakaje about her pioneering journey to the catwalk. Carlos Cano used to belong to a Colombian paramilitary group, but found himself crossing into former enemy territory when he became a maths teacher. Jo Milne was born deaf and could hear practically nothing until she was 39. When she started to go blind as well she decided to have cochlear implants fitted - they allowed her to hear clearly for the first time and enter a whole new sensory world.
