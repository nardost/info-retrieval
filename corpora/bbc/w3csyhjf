Born under apartheid and in poverty, South African composer Lebo M grew up loving music and became a performer at a young age. His talent took him on a tumultuous journey from Soweto to Hollywood. As he worked on the music for Disney's hit animation The Lion King and as apartheid came to an end in South Africa, the story of those lions fighting for their kingdom took on a whole new relevance to him. Rosalyn Wilder always dreamed of working in show business. There was one job she had that she could never forget â€” trying to get Hollywood superstar Judy Garland on stage for her final performances in London in the 1960s. She remembers the singer's struggles with addiction and confidence. Rosalyn's relationship with Garland is portrayed in the film, Judy.
