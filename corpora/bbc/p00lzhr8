We take an in depth look at the unprecedented financial crisis the world is now facing in our New Global Economy. Three highly distinguished professors of economics put forward their plans – for at least partial – recovery. Far East expert Danny Quah suggests that China can play a vital role to help stabilise and revive the world economy. The Middle East specialist Timur Kuran calls for the modernising of the economies of many Islamic countries, which he believes have been held back because of religious law. And the eminent economic historian and member of the British House of Lords, Robert Skidelsky advocates kick starting stagnant economies by sprinkling them with "helicopter money" – spending vouchers given to people with an expiry date to make them spend money they would not otherwise spend.
