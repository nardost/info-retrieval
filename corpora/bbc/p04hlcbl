Dr. Mike Toft is a South African vet who's been taking drastic measures to protect rhinos in the KwaZulu-Natal region. He's dehorning the animals as a means to deter poachers. The horns are then secretly sent to an undisclosed location where they can be kept from entering the black market. The BBC's Gavin Fischer reports from the Zululand Rhino reserve. Saroo Brierley started life in India, fell asleep on a train at the age of five and ended up being sent for adoption in Australia. He was 'a little boy lost' who didn't even know the name of his hometown. But, 25 years later, he found his birth family again by zooming in on internet maps, matching landmarks with those from his childhood memory. His story has now been made into the Hollywood film Lion starring Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman. He spoke to Outlook's Matthew Bannister in 2012 - just weeks after he was first reunited with his mother. Yolande Mabika was part of Team Refugee at this year's Rio Olympics competing in the judo round. Originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo, she describes how she was separated from her family during the Second Congo War. Richmond Shepard is an 87-year-old mime artist from New York - he says he's one of the few remaining professional mimes still working in the US - and claims he's certainly the oldest. Richmond's had an illustrious career, including working with the famous French mime artist Marcel Marceau. Outlook's Sorcha Glackin went to see him teaching a mime class.
