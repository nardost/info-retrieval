Norwegian Karina Hollekim was one of the world's greatest 'Base' jumpers. She suffered a near-fatal crash in 2006 but defied the doctors to walk again. Also, we mark Nelson Mandela's death with the next in our series of extracts from his book Long Walk To Freedom. American Amy Espeseth grew up in an isolated religious community. That experience forms the backdrop to her new novel Sufficient Grace. Two people named after Nelson Mandela describe the influence the name has had on them: Londoner Mandela Darani and Mandela Barnes from the American mid-west.
