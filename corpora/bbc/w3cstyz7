Country music singer Bryan Hopkins was at a music festival in Las Vegas on October 1st when Stephen Paddock opened fire on the crowd. Bryan had played at the venue before so he knew where to hide. He then helped several people to escape by hiding in a freezer. British writer Robert Macfarlane has travelled the world, often on foot. During these trips he realised that the words we use to describe our landscape are changing and some are disappearing altogether. So he started collecting them. When Tererai Trent was growing up in a village in rural Zimbabwe in the 1970s, the future looked bleak. She seemed set to repeat the pattern followed by her female ancestors - marrying young, mothering many children and living a life of poverty. But Tererai was determined to break the cycle. She now has 3 university degrees. Image: Concertgoers running away from the scene of the attack in Las Vegas on October 1st Credit: David Becker/Getty Images Show less
