In 2012 he returned home and set up the Sierra Leone Memory Project, dedicated to recording the testimonies of those who survived the civil war.

But Zarifa Qazizadah has broken through the barriers to become leader of the 700 families who live in Naw Abad, near Mazar-e-Sharif. She represents the community in district government meetings and officiates in local disputes.
