Personal stories behind the news from all over the world. With Matthew Bannister. Eritrean journalist, women accused of witchcraft, Money launderer turned crime-spotter Eritrean journalist Yonas Embye was imprisoned for four years without trial, because, he says, he was critical of the Eritrean regime. He eventually escaped by using a fork to scrape away the mortar between the bricks in his cell. He fled first to Sudan and then to Uganda, where he now keeps a daily vigil outside parliamentary offices, aiming to draw attention to the Eritrean government's treatment of journalists. He talks to Matthew Bannister about his arrest. Women accused of witchcraft In Burkina Faso in west Africa, thousands of women are being falsely accused of witchcraft and forced out of their homes. They are usually elderly and vulnerable, unable to defend themselves. For Outlook, Blanche Girouard talks to some of these women at the Maison Delwende refuge in Ougadougou, and hears about the campaign by community leaders to end this abuse of human rights.
