The Pakistani army has quashed the Taliban in tribal areas such as Swat by the use of military force. But has the problem of militancy been resolved? And how serious is the threat from Islamist insurgents in the heartlands of Pakistan, particularly the Punjab? Owen Bennett-Jones investigates the appeal of these movements to young Pakistanis. How much are they about fundamentalist Islam? And how much are they a reaction to grievances about land, jobs and poverty? Owen travels across the country, meeting both feudal landowners and the young Punjabis who are attracted by the lure of militancy. Presenter: Owen Bennett-Jones Producer: Shelley Thakral. Show less
