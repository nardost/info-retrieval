Allan Haber was once a heroin addict and a prolific drug dealer who has spent more than 15 years behind bars. He spent time in many notorious prisons including Sing Sing and Rikers Island. But during one stay he found the courage to reform his life, and chose a very unlikely career. We meet the one-legged dancer who became a sensation on the TV show India's Got Talent. When she was growing up in the Indian state of Punjab, Subhreet Kaur Ghumman loved to dance. But she wasn't confident enough to think of becoming a professional. Instead, she followed her family's wishes and signed up to train as a nurse. In the first week of her training, she was involved in an accident that changed her life forever. Until recently it was a serious offence for people to gather in groups on the streets of Myanmar. But things are changing. Each week, punk musician Kyaw Kyaw, along with his band mates, friends and supporters, distribute food to people living on the streets of Yangon. In 2007 Phyllis Omido began working in the offices of a factory in Mombasa which melted down old batteries for use in solar panels. Soon after she started the job, her baby son fell ill. As she desperately tried to find out what was wrong, she stumbled across a pollution problem which was affecting the lives of people who lived near the plant. At great personal cost, she quit her job to take on the company - and the government.
