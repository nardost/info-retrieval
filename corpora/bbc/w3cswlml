Earlier this year a princess from Dubai, Latifa, tried to escape and start a new life abroad, away from her father, the ruler. Her best friend Tiina Jauhianen tried to help her but Latifa was caught on a boat, and hasn't been seen since. Vanley Burke has been called "the godfather of black photography" in Britain. He came to the UK from Jamaica when he was a young teenager - this was in the 1960s, racism was rife, and Vanley was painfully aware of how black people were portrayed in the media, and how different that portrayal was from the reality. So he set about photographing the everyday lives of people in his community. Image: Tiina Jauhianen Credit: BBC Show less
