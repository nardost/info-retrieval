Maryse Etrenne was buried under rubble during the Haiti earthquake of 2010. She had to have her lower leg amputated, but is now so proud of her prosthetic limb that she has become a support worker for other disabled people in her neighbourhood. Also, Eric Brossier and France Pinczon du Sel spend nine months of the year on a boat trapped in Arctic ice. They make their living by carrying out measurements for scientists and helping travellers in the region. Also living on the boat are the couple's two young daughters. And how Peter Jones, a man who lost his wife to a sudden brain haemorrhage, vowed to transform his life and find the key to happiness. He quit his job as a banker and wrote the self-help book "How to do Everything and be Happy". Picture: Maryse Etrenne Picture Credit: Wendy Hughe/Handicap International. Show less
