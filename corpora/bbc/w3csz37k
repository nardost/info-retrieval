This week a US judge sentenced Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán to life in prison plus 30 years. The trial is significant because El Chapo achieved notoriety for twice escaping custody in Mexico as well as avoiding arrest on numerous other occasions. One of these arrests was in 2014 and was the culmination of years of work by an American drug enforcement agent called Drew Hogan. When Drew started searching for the world's most wanted drug lord, he wasn't aware how consumed he would become with the hunt. From organising undercover money laundering operations to camping out in the kingpin's house in Mexico, Drew was about to embark on an extraordinary quest.
