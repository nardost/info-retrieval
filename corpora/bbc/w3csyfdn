Today, Leon Bosch is one of the most respected classical double bass players in the world but as a teenager he was made a political prisoner in South Africa because of his peaceful resistance to the apartheid regime – an experience that has haunted him for most of his life. But that time in prison also drove him to commit to playing the double bass with a passion; he speaks to Jo Fidgen about how he has used his music to resist a system that said he would never amount to anything. Clarence B Jones was speechwriter and lawyer to civil rights leader Martin Luther King. Clarence was reluctant when he was first approached about the job but Clarence soon became a trusted member of his team. For the famous march on Washington in 1963, he wrote Dr King a speech. Though there would be a surprise in store for him… Clarence tells Outlook how Dr King came to make his iconic ‘I have a dream’ speech. Another man who knew Martin Luther King well is Tom Houck, a white teenager who accidentally became his chauffeur. Tom was a 19 year old activist when he met Dr King. He tells Outlook’s Emily Webb about getting to know Dr King and his family. Picture: Double-bass player Leon Bosch Credit: Photography Juno Snowdon / Art Direction Adam Hypki Show less
