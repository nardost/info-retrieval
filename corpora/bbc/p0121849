This week on the Forum: more countries around the world are starting to measure not only their Gross National Product, but also their citizens’ happiness. Host Emily Kasriel asks how do we find contentment? American positive psychologist Todd Kashdan believes that being curious is the key to happiness. Belgian environmental scientist Eric Lambin argues that our lives can be enriched by a more intimate relationship with nature. And novelist Eva Hoffman’s recipe for happiness is about learning to use our time meaningfully, not hoarding it too preciously but sharing it generously with others. Illustration by Emily Kasriel.
