Tom Huntley takes us inside a notorious American jail. This Dallas-born son of a local policeman was sentenced to 50 years for armed robbery. Once inside the 'hellish' Eastham Unit Tom ended up policing his fellow inmates during one of the most violent prison riots Texas has ever seen. Natasha Annie Tonthola shares her experience of a coming-of-age ritual she had to endure in a rural southern village in Malawi. She went though the "hyena" ritual, where an older man is brought in to have sex with teenage girls in an initiation ceremony. Hear how she turned this devastating and shocking experience into something good. (Photo: Light seeps through a closed door. Credit: Romeo Gacad/AFP/Getty Images) Show less
