Zelda La Grange spent 19 years at Mandela's side as his personal assistant. But during her childhood in the apartheid years, Zelda thought of Mandela as the enemy. Everything changed when they met. She's written a book about her time working for one of the world's most remarkable men - it's called Good Morning Mr Mandela. Inna Romanenko is a Ukrainian refugee who's been living in former President Viktor Yanukovych's palace for just over a month. She and her young children had to flee the violence in eastern Ukraine. Kutumba is a modern band from Kathmandu, Nepal, playing on traditional instruments. They're acquiring a growing international reputation for saving these instruments from the museums.
