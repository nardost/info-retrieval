Today, there’s a curative feel to the programme as we explore how to heal old political scars, nurture the planet and imagine a positive future. One of the key negotiators of the Northern Ireland peace process, Lord John Alderdice, explains how to use psychotherapy to bring peace. Forget the rise of Asia: Columbian law lecturer and writer, Oscar Guardiola Rivera is here to tell us why he thinks it’s time for Latin America to assert itself. And the untapped chemical potential of trees with Irish “renegade scientist” and writer Diana Beresford-Kroeger. Using psychoanalysis, Latin power and trees to bring opposing sides to the table to establish peace. Illustration by Emily Kasriel. Show less
