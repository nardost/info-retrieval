This week’s Forum visits the Women of the World festival at London’s South Bank cultural centre, where Bridget Kendall is joined by four extraordinary women, each with a different story to tell, and all of them inspiring role models in their own fields: Ghanaian blogger and fashion label owner Nana Darkoa Sekyiamah, Jamaican performance poet Jean ‘Binta’ Breeze, Jamaican-British cellist, singer and composer Ayanna Witter-Johnson and Nigerian-British space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock. How hard was it to achieve their ambitions? And what do they see as the biggest obstacles for women in the world today? With live music from Ayanna Witter-Johnson and poetry readings by Jean ‘Binta’ Breeze. Show less
