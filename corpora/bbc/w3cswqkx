South African journalist Gavin Fischer gets exclusive access to newly available recordings from one of the most significant trials in modern political history – The Rivonia Trial. He has a personal connection. His great-uncle Bram Fischer led the defence of Nelson Mandela and his co-accused during the trial in the early 1960s. Bram died in prison before Gavin was born. So this is the first time Gavin has heard his voice. Gavin looks back on the trial and Bram’s decision to use his white privilege to fight apartheid – rather than be part of it – with Denis Goldberg, one of the last survivors of the trial. He looks at the untold tales of those who were forced to testify as part of the prosecution case. The workers - at the Liliesleaf Farm, where top members of the apartheid resistance used to meet and were arrested - were detained by police before the trial. They were subjected to violence and threats to try and elicit information and forced to testify. Gavin also traces the relatives of some of those who testified in order to play the tapes to them. And in the recordings of the testimonies are revealed smaller moments of defiance, of tragedy and of hope, which are vital to understanding South Africa today.
