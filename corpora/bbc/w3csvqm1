The fascinating, and morally equivocal story of an American journalist and how he came by an exclusive that saved his career. Michael Finkel unexpectedly came into contact with Christian Longo when he discovered that Christian, who'd been accused of murdering his wife, MaryJane, and their three young children, had also stolen Mike's identity. Mike became close to Christian as he investigated the charges against him. Mike was accused of putting his own interests above the interests of justice, and of profiting from a despicable crime. He wrote a book about it, which has recently been turned into a Hollywood film. He speaks to Jo Fidgen about why he made the decisions he did, and the impact it's had on his life. Outlook's Mpho Lakaje talks to the children of a missing anti-apartheid hero Mbuyisa Makhubu as they try to solve the mystery behind his disappearance. In New York's Flower District the sidewalks are lined with plants and blooms from every corner of the world. There's an old warehouse on this street, and a shop on its fifth floor, where beautiful bouquets are assembled for people who don't really exist and occasions that aren't going to happen. Outlook's Colm Flynn went to meet Tess Casey who works there making floral displays and bouquets for the movie industry. Including extracts from Sex and the City Movie produced by Michael Patrick King, John Melfi, Sarah Jessica Parker and Boadwalk Empire produced by Darren Star and Terence Winter, Martin Scorsese, Mark Wahlberg, Tim Van Patten, Howard Korder and Stephen Levinson.
