Matthew Bannister talks to Karen Gravano, the daughter of a Mafia boss. She describes what it was like to grow up with a man who killed 19 people, and the life of luxury that went with it. We also find out what it's like to live in one of the most remote places in the world - Niaqornat in north west Greenland, which has a population 59. We speak to a British film maker who travelled there to make a documentary and teenager, Lars Kristian Kruse who dreams of leaving Niaqornat and seeing the world. Show less
