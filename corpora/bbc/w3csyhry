Outlook’s Abdulmalik Fahd undertakes a challenge: to travel around Lagos by car and canoe to record six interviewees in one day. First stop a police station, to talk to Celestina Nwankwo Kalu, the police officer who helped save Friday Ajobor, a gun attack victim, and who now calls him her son. Next, a voyage into the floating neighbourhood of Makoko – one of the biggest slums in the city – to meet Abigail Mpke, the make-up artist mapping her neighbourhood. Then on to a busy market to meet Ernestina Okwuchukwu, aka Madame Burgess. She was left with nothing but a new-born baby when her husband died, but her determination to feed her young family and talent for the Lagos hustle led her to become a top car tyre salesman in the area. And finally, we hear from Opemipo Kehinde and… Opemipo Kehinde. Now husband and wife, they tell us how their love story started on the streets of Lagos, during an evening commute.
