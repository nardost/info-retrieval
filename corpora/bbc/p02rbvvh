Edwin Sabuhoro is a former park ranger from Rwanda who's come up with a novel way of tackling poachers. He is literally turning them into gamekeepers. Edwin works in Volcanoes National Park in the North of the country. The area is covered in rainforest and bamboo, and is home to unique wildlife - including mountain gorillas - who are often targeted by poachers. Edwin's work has been recognised by the Rwandan government and also by US President Barack Obama. Last time the rock band U2 went on the road back in 2009, the massive production grossed over half a billion pounds - more than any other rock tour ever. Now they're at it again, but this time they've gone back to basics. They're aiming to remind fans that for all their money and celebrity U2 are still four guys who grew up in the suburbs of Dublin. The band's lead singer Bono talks to the BBC's Kirsty Lang. Ishwor Ghimire grew up in an orphanage in the Nepali city of Kathmandu. Then he went to school in Australia. But when the earthquake struck on 25th of April - he was back at the orphanage and played a big part in evacuating the children who were living there. Ishwor told Outlook's Joel Cox about his early memories of life in the orphanage, which was run by a community worker called Mother Rajan. Brenda Myers Powell had a childhood of terrible abuse then spent twenty five years working as a prostitute in the American city of Chicago. But now she's broken out of this destructive cycle, to help other women and girls avoid the life she led. She's set up an organisation called The Dreamcatcher Foundation. When she isn't going into schools to offer advice to young girls, she drives her brightly coloured van through the city streets, giving support to prostitutes.
