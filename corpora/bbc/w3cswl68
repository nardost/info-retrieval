In 2014, Denise Ho was a Cantopop music sensation. After winning a major talent competition, she became one of the biggest stars in Hong Kong's music scene and beyond. But when pro-democracy protesters took to the streets that year, she joined in not only on the streets but by singing a song that became the anthem of the movement, an act that would put her career in jeopardy. Mustapha Sallah hosts a unique radio show in The Gambia. He uses his platform to warn his listeners not to try to get to Europe after his own disastrous experience. After taking a break from Lucha Libre wrestling, Paola Medina decided to start cliff-diving in Acapulco, Mexico. Now, she transforms her wrestling moves into aerial shapes as she leaps from dizzying heights into the ocean. Outlook's Clayton Conn went to meet her. Image and credit: Denise Ho Show less
