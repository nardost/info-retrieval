The B-Flat Piano Sonata D960, which Schubert completed two months before his death, in 1828, is a vast and complex work. It is the last of a triptych of piano sonatas that Schubert wrote, possibly in response to the death of his hero Beethoven the year before. Schubert had been a pallbearer at Beethoven’s funeral. In this programme, pianists Imogen Cooper, Steven Osborne and James Lisney consider what it is like to play this work. And Andrea Avery and Pamela Rose describe ways in which this sonata has marked and shaped their lives. (Photo: Portrait of Franz Peter Schubert (Vienna, 1797-1828), Austrian composer. Credit: DEA/A.
