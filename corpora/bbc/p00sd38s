Last month, ambitious plans to mine asteroids were unveiled to the world's media. But there's an equally alien landscape closer to home which is set to be mined much sooner - the bottom of our oceans. A number of proposals are under consideration, many in the South Pacific. Papua New Guinea has already became the first country to grant a licence for deep sea mining off its coast. On this week's One Planet we hear from Australia, where a number of companies interested in mining the sea bed have based their operations. Plus we speak to the International Seabed Authority - the body set up to monitor exploration of the sea floor. Also on the show we chat to musician Bernard Krause who has travelled the world recording the sounds of nature. He explains why what you can hear, rather than what you can see, tells you more about the health of a habitat.
