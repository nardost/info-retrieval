Ron Stallworth was one of the first black men to become a police cadet in Colorado Springs. Then he was given the task of going undercover to gather intelligence on the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. He spoke to high-level members on the phone and a white colleague went to the KKK meetings in his place. The information Ron accumulated was used to help prevent the group's attacks. The Italian city of Livorno was hit by devastating floods last month. Part of the city was destroyed and seven people lost their lives. Among the many buildings that were damaged was the house belonging to photographer Daniele Dainelli. Inside was an archive of his early photos. So a group of people have banded together to find and save the photographs and negatives. Baset Azizi is a professional trumpet player in Afghanistan. In fact, he's one of the best in the country. But when Baset's teacher moved away, and conflict meant he was left without a replacement, he turned to the internet to find another. That's how he met trumpeter David Bilger and an unlikely friendship began. Ella Slack, from the Isle of Man, used to work for the BBC, and she's spent 30 years being a stand-in for Queen Elizabeth. Since the 1980s, she's deputised for the Queen during rehearsals for televised royal engagements. She's done it more than 50 times. (Picture credit: Ron Stallworth.) Show less
