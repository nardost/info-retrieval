Filmmaker and ex-marine Elegance Bratton slept on the streets of New York and New Jersey for eight years but he didn't realise he was homeless. He was part of the local gay community and, despite his situation, felt like he had found his home. Around twenty years ago, Merced Guimaraes moved in to a new house in Rio de Janeiro with her husband and children. In her new garden, Merced made a startling discovery: human remains that she initially thought must be the result of a series of murders. The reality was even more surprising, it was a graveyard for slaves, brought over to Brazil from Africa. No matter how much you think you love ice cream, you do not love it as much as Caroline and Robin Weir. The British couple have more than fourteen thousand items of ice cream paraphernalia, including moulds, scoops and machines, some more than two hundred years old. Their collection is on display in London at the moment, and Outlook's Sophie Eastaugh went to meet them there to talk about the joy of all things iced.
