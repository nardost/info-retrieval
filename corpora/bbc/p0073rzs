Zimbabwe's forbidden artist Prominent Zimbabwean artist Owen Maseko has had his latest exhibition closed down by police and charged with undermining the authority of the president. His work depicts the political violence carried out by Mugabe supporters in the years following independence. Now as he awaits trial, Owen tells Matthew Bannister about the childhood experiences which inspire his art. Nuns in the City The Carmelite Monastery of the Most Holy Trinity is a silent order of nuns based in London's Notting Hill Gate. It's so closed off that even people who live in the same square aren't aware of its existence. One local resident who did notice them is the documentary film director Michael Whyte. Ten years after his first approach to the Prioress he was allowed in to make a film. He tells about this silent community of women who've turned their back on modern life and embraced one of prayer and penance. The drain cleaners of Banjul. Over the last few months we've been following an expedition called Atlantic Rising. The team are on a journey around the Atlantic coastline of a number of countries - looking at how rising seas could affect the people who live there. One of the places they've visited is the Gambian capital Banjul. Two years ago the city was swamped by high tides and thousands had to flee their homes. Banjul was built half a metre below sea level and relies on clear and free flowing drains to take the water away. We meet the drain cleaners of Banjul. Show less
