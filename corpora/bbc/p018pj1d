Episode 6/6. Egypt has one of the world’s fastest-growing populations; already 90-million strong. It is growing by over a million each year and around half of that population is under the age of 25. It was Egypt’s youth who were at the forefront of the revolutionary protests in Tahrir Square in 2011. They were demanding an end to corruption, cronyism, poverty and to social injustice. Two years on has the revolution delivered for them? In this final programme in the series, Egypt’s Challenge, Shaimaa Khalil talks to young people in Cairo and Alexandria and finds a generation caught between hope and despair.
