As Start the Week returns to Radio 4, Tom Sutcliffe talks to Margaret Atwood about her vision of the future. In the last of a trilogy of dystopian novels, Atwood charts the fortunes of a group of survivors after a man-made plague has devastated the world. There's more man-made corruption and savagery in Vicky Featherstone's first production as the new Artistic Director of the Royal Court Theatre: The Ritual Slaughter of Gorge Mastromas is a dark morality tale. But the philosopher A C Grayling goes back to the Greeks to explore the best of humanity - friendship. Producer: Katy Hickman. Show less
