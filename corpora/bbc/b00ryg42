Clive Stafford Smith is a lawyer working for human rights both in Britain and abroad - he campaigns for the rights of prisoners on death row in the US and in Guantanamo Bay. His nomination for a life worth celebrating is at first surprising - it's the entirely fictitious Robin Hood. But, he argues in conversation with medievalist Professor Stephen Knight, the myth has a lot to teach us about the way we treat each other. The presenter is Matthew Parris. Produced by Christine Hall. Show less
