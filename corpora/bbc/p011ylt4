Robin Reineke identifies the bodies of illegal migrants who have died while trying to cross from Mexico to the United States. She tells Matthew Bannister how she uses her skills as a cultural anthropologist to piece together tiny clues about the identity of those who have died. Also, Rajesh Kumar, the Delhi shopkeeper who's set up a school for street children under a bridge. And Jean Le Cam, the round the world yachtsman who was trapped under his boat for eighteen hours.
