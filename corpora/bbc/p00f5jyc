From Italy to India, David Goldblatt examines the ever changing face of Formula One. At the Monza Circuit in Northern Italy, David discovers the triumphs, tragedies and the nostalgic old style glamour of a past motor racing era in a town that has been hosting the Italian Grand Prix since long before the arrival of Formula One. But now a global super brand, Formula One has changed. David also visits the embryonic circuit on the outskirts of Delhi, which in October 2011 will become Formula One's latest hi-tech venue.
