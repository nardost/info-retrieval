Is Iran at a turning point following the election of the new President, Hassan Rouhani? Within days of coming to power, he promised a new approach to domestic and international affairs - a new policy of openness on the country’s nuclear programme, to release political prisoners, get economic sanctions lifted and pursue a less confrontational policy with the West. For some it was a welcome new dawn. For others, like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Rouhani is a wolf in sheep’s clothing – out to deceive the West until Iran becomes too powerful to stop. Pooneh Ghoddoosi of the BBC’s Persian TV service looks back at President Rouhani’s first 100 days in office. She brings together a select group of Iran watchers to ask whether things in their country are genuinely changing. (Photo: Hassan Rouhani. Credit: Ta Kenare/AFP/Getty Images) Show less
