When Matjames Metson was 18, his partner gave birth to a baby girl named Tyler. Overwhelmed by the circumstances, Matjames decided to run away. Sixteen years later, when he was at his lowest point in his life, Matjames got a phone call from Tyler - the daughter he had left behind. He told Jo Fidgen how that phone call changed his life. Gilberto ‘Chito’ Shedden is a fisherman from Siquirres, in Costa Rica. Years ago he befriended a crocodile called Pocho. Clayton Conn went to meet him.
