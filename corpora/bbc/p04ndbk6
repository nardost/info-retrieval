Bongani Njoli is one of South Africa's most in-demand voiceover artists. He got his big break during apartheid, but he started out working in a toilet paper factory. In Hong Kong Au Yeung Ping-Chi has taken Chinese funeral traditions in a new direction. Instead of paper money, he makes intricate paper models of objects like micro scooters and computer game consoles to be burnt and sent to the dead in the afterlife. Fiona Reeves reads thousands of letters sent to President Obama by the American people each day. She then selects ten of them for the President to read every night.
