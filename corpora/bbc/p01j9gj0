British vascular surgeon David Nott is just back from volunteering on the Syrian frontline. His work in war zones has earned him the nickname 'the Indiana Jones of surgery'. Lydia Whitlock has turned her hilarious experiences as a Hollywood personal assistant to her advantage in her book: To My Future Assistant. Vieux Farka Toure is a young Malian guitarist and the son of Ali Farka Toure. His latest album is called Mon Pays - my country - and he talks about Mali's recent troubles. And - from punk to world class chef: the Brazilian chef Alex Atala on his passion for the rainforest. Picture: Vascular Surgeon David Nott (left) with Lucy Ash in the Outlook studio. Show less
