Neli Delgado set up a chicken shop in Mexico City after escaping her sex traffickers. Monique Golda Nerman was travelling in India when she fell in loveâ€¦ with a street dog. She and King Tommy the dog now travel the world together. Krystyna Farley is a 91-year-old senior beauty queen in the US state of Connecticut. But her background is worlds away from the glitter and glamour - she grew up in Poland during the war and was interned in a Siberian labour camp. Outlook's Sorcha Glackin went to meet her.
