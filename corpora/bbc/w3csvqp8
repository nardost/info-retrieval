Richard Moore was 10 when he was blinded by a rubber bullet in Northern Ireland. Charles Innes is the British soldier who shot him in 1972 during the Troubles. Today they are friends. Annie Spence takes us into her library in Michigan where she writes love letters to her favourite literary characters. She has compiled these letters into a book called 'Dear Fahrenheit 451'. Reality TV star Gulabo Sapera danced with snakes as a child, before embarking on a career on stage with her own dance style. She'd had a difficult upbringing as a member of a nomadic snake charming community, and had survived being buried alive at birth. British Zimbabwean fashion designer Natsai Audre Chieza explains why she's trying to help the environment by using bacteria to dye her outfits. (Photo: (L) Charles Innes and (R) Richard Moore.
