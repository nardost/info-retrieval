Sarah Mardini and her younger sister Yusra are both world class swimmers from Syria. When they were trying to flee their war torn country the sisters' talent saved the lives of 18 people when their boat got into trouble in the middle of the Mediterranean sea. They pushed the boat to safety and Sarah tells Outlook what that experience was like. Brazilian daredevil Lucius Zafalon travels the world putting his life on the line every day. He is part of a team of motorcyclists who entertain the public by riding their bikes at top speed around the inside of a massive steel ball called the Globe of Death. He tells Outlook how he prepares for his stunts. What happens to sex workers when they retire? In Mexico many elderly former sex workers were outcasts from their families and left to live on the streets. That was until Carmen Munoz came along. A former sex worker herself, she tells Outlook's Clayton Conn how she opened a retirement home for her colleagues. Many of us grow vegetables to eat, or flowers in our gardens, but Gavin Munro has gone one step further - he grows furniture in the UK. Gavin's been developing techniques to grow trees into the shape of chairs, tables and lamps on his farm and tells Outlook where the inspiration came from.
