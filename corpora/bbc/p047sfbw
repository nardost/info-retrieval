When Peter White jets, sails or walks into a new city, it is the sounds, not the sights, which assail him. He sets off to Rio on the eve of the Paralympics. In Rio he finds a city poised with excitement as the Paralympics are set to begin. Like some of the arriving athletes, he is forced to navigate a strange environment without being able to see his way around: “Having been born blind, I’ve always travelled blind – and for me, sightseeing is more a case of ‘sound-hearing.” (Photo: Aerial view of Christ the Redeemer, Flamengo Beach, the Sugar Loaf and Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2015.
