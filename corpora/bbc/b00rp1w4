Mongolia is in the grip of the deadliest winter for a decade. People have died because they can't reach doctors or hospitals and malnutrition is increasing fast. Most significantly for a nation where tending livestock is central to its culture, untold millions of animals have died. Frozen carcasses of sheep and goats litter parts of the country. Linda Pressly travels to the remote far west of the country to report on this developing emergency. She asks what it means for Mongolia as rural refugees from the deep freeze have flooded to the capital, Ulan Bator. And she asks about the prospects of a brighter future with recent discovery of what may be the world's largest deposits of gold. Producer: Linda Sills. Show less
