Gloria Allred is a lawyer who has represented the female accusers of Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and R Kelly. She reveals how her own experience of sexual assault made her determined to give other women a voice. Horatio Chapple had an idea to create a garden at the Spinal Treatment Centre in Salisbury, UK. Before he could bring his idea to life, Horatio tragically lost his life when he was attacked by a polar bear whilst on an adventure holiday to Svalbard, he was only 17. Following his death, his mum Olivia Chapple took on the project. Through the charity she set up in her son's name, Horatio's Garden now has three gardens at spinal injury centres across the UK.
