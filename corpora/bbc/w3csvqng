Londoner Michael Balogun spent most of his early life in and out of prison for drug dealing and a firearms offence. While serving time in prison, Michael was given the opportunity to work in the kitchen at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA), which is one of the world's leading drama schools. It was while working at RADA that Michael was inspired to become an actor. But is it possible to act your way out of crime? The search is on for the world's most inspiring people. A couple of years ago we started the Outlook Inspirations Awards. They celebrate some of the most inspiring people interviewed on Outlook or nominated by listeners. One of the winners was Kees Veldboer, an ambulance driver from the Netherlands, who started a charity called the Ambulance Wish Foundation. He grants the last wishes of the dying. For example, going to the beach, meeting a celebrity, or going to an art gallery to see a favourite painting one last time. Matthew Bannister found out what Kees has been doing since he won the award in 2016. Can money buy you happiness? Larry Woods, also known as Mr Sunshine, is an American who lives and works in New Zealand. He is also a former multi-millionaire, but he lost his fortune and now offers a free shoe shining service on the streets of Auckland. Image: Michael Balogun Credit: Simon Annand Show less
