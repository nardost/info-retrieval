Grass Roots: The impact and influence of ‘people’s movements. How have grass movements have evolved and how are they responding to a world where there is increased democracy but increased challenge too. Looking at a shack dwellers movement in South Africa, rights organisations in Latin America and the Maker Movement in the United States, Bridget Kendall and guests explore how grass roots groups are working today and how they may develop in the future with S’bu Zikode, Professor Joe Foweraker and Gene Sherman.
