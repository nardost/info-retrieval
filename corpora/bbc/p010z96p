Somali artist Abdullah Abdirahman Abdullah has spent the last few years fearing for his life. After the Islamist insurgent group al-Shabab took over parts of Somalia, his drawings were deemed un-Islamic. To escape from the group Abdullah and his family went into hiding in 2007. But, earlier this year, he emerged from the shadows and joined a group of artists who are promoting peace through giant paintings spread across Mogadishu. Also the South African photographer who heads into the eye of the storm. And the Brazilian father and son who rescued a rare bird of prey in the Amazon rainforest.
