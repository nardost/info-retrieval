Saa Sabas from Guinea talks about how he survived the Ebola virus that he caught from his father in April this year. After Saa recovered, the people of his neighbourhood were afraid to come into contact with him, but the neighbourhood Chief took him by the hand to show he wasn't contagious any more. Saa is now campaigning to fight the misconceptions about the virus. Everett Alvarez is a former US Navy pilot. 50 years ago this week, his plane was shot down over the South China Sea. He was captured by the North Vietnamese and spent the next eight and a half years as a prisoner of war, becoming one of the longest held American POWs in history. Everett tells reporter Jane O'Brien his story. Samson Diamond, leader of the Odeion string quartet, talks about their performance of specially composed music marking twenty years since the first democratic elections in South Africa. Reporter Candida Beveridge meets Dr Bubi Arce who retrieved the bodies of over two thousand people killed when Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines last November. Thanks to Dr Arce, they are now laid to rest at the Holy Cross cemetery in Tacloban, each with a proper burial site. Irish singer-songwriter Sinead O'Connor talks about the glamorous new image she chose for her latest album cover and why her nineties hit "Nothing Compares 2 U" still means a lot to her even now.
