Anaïs Bordier had no idea her identical twin sister was on the other side of the world until she saw a YouTube video of a woman who looked remarkably like her. It turned out to be American film actress Samantha Futerman. Anaïs tracked her doppelgänger down, and they agreed to speak online. Turns out they were both born in South Korea and separated at birth. Anaïs was adopted by a French family, and Samantha was adopted by an American one. This is the story of what happened when they met in person. Mexican artist Julia Lopez is now a world renowned painter, but she very nearly didn't discover her talent at all. She grew up as a farm labourer in rural Mexico, and found work as a maid after moving to Mexico City. But one day her life changed, when she was scouted by the famous artist Frida Kahlo to become a model. It wasn’t long before she picked up the paintbrush herself. Outlook's Clayton Conn has the story. (Image: Anaïs Bordier (l) and Samantha Futerman. Photo credit: Ryan Miyamoto, Small Package Films.) Show less
