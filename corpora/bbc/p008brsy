At a special show recorded at the Science Museum, Danish neuroscientist Morten Kringlebach delves deep into the brain to understand what triggers pleasure - and pain - on a quest for new insights into human nature. Scottish writer and comedienne A L Kennedy probes the moments when we aren't sure who we are: the tortured uncertainties of adolescence. And what happens to us when we fall in love. And Australian bioethicist Julian Savulescu asks us to expand the frontiers of what it means to be human by embracing the brave new world of genetic enhancement. Who are we? Are we our brain? How can love and genetic enhancement affect us? Illustration by Emily Kasriel. Show less
