Broadcaster Colin Murray chooses Francis Albert Sinatra in the biographical series in which Matthew Parris asks his guests to choose someone who's inspired their lives. "Fiercely competitive", "aggressive", "utterly masculine" and "supremely talented". Just some of the words - Matthew Parris says - that might be used to describe one of the greatest entertainers of the 20th century. Colin calls Frank omnipresent. Enchanted by his songs he says: "It's not about the notes you hit for me, it's about the simplicity and the honesty. And for me he had it in bucket loads" New York author and music critic Will Friedwald vividly describes the singer's life history, from his early years to the marriages and through his recording and screen career. Featuring excerpts of many of Sinatra's greatest recordings. Produced by Beth O'Dea First broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2009. Show less
