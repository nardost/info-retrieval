The term subculture has often been used to describe counter cultural youth groups such as Teddy Boys and Goths. But this week Thinking Allowed hears from young sociologists from York University who've explored the sub culture of pop fans. What are the attractions of belonging to such communities of music enthusiasts? Tonya Anderson talks about women in their forties who link up with other Duran Duran fans via the internet in their bedrooms. And Rosemary Hill reveals the altogether noisier world of female heavy metal aficionados. Professor Angela McRobbie joins Laurie Taylor in the studio to ask where the fans of teen pop and heavy metal do or don't fit into the history and meaning of subcultures. Show less
