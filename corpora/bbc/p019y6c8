Anna Canaday and Rhona Crosswhite are two teachers who used their own bodies to save children by lying over them as their school was torn apart by a devastating tornado in Moore, Oklahoma. Anna describes how she sheltered children even as a car and then a wall landed on top of her. Hollywood's top chef Wolfgang Puck tells us about his disastrous start in cooking. We meet the magician who started learning tricks to ward off school bullies. And we hear from the celebrated science fiction writer Brian Aldiss, who describes how his own troubled birth inspired his latest novel.
