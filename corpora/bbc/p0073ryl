Across the Western world it's no longer the threat from al-Qaeda that governments are most concerned about. Instead, it's home-grown terror plots hatched by their own citizens. In this three-part series, Peter Taylor investigates the terrorist threat from young Muslims radicalised on the internet. Although extremists represent a tiny minority of the Muslim community, some would argue they now constitute the single biggest threat to national security. In the third episode, Peter looks at why the British government is now investing big money in trying to combat the appeal of radical Islam. But will its strategy work? The British Government is spending £140m trying to counter radicalisation in the UK – it’s a policy called Prevent. Sir Norman Bettison, Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police in the UK believes that it will be with us for many years to come. “I think this is generational, I think we woke up as a society in 2005 to the idea that people were prepared to commit suicide and carry out atrocities in Britain because of the perversion of an ideology. I think it’s a generation of treatment to prevent the infection spreading, and I think that that will take us probably 20 years.” Travelling across the UK Peter Taylor looks at what Prevent means in practice and how it’s attempting to head off the violent extremists in their tracks. He speaks exclusively to “Kasim” - a man who took his own journey to Pakistan - to the very heart of violent Jihad. He almost lost his life in a US drone strike before he renounced violent extremism. “Kasim” doesn’t see any change on the horizon. Show less
