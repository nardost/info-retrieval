Stephanie Summerville tells us about her eye-opening experience as a casual worker. It was her first job and it thrust her into a shocking situation. She was providing respite care for a terminally-ill man in her hometown of Evansville, in Indiana. As she looked around his bedroom she saw a white robe and a hood with eyeholes cut out. Stephanie was a young black woman and this was the unmistakable uniform of the Ku Klux Klan. She spoke to Mariana Des Forges about her extraordinary experience. Patrick Baty is the paint detective - a paint expert who helps people restore old buildings by investigating the original colours and types of paint used. It’s a highly specialised field that requires the skills of historian, detective and analyst. After Manasi Joshi had to have her leg amputated following a road accident, she discovered para-badminton, a sport which would propel her to success and fame in India, earning her the title of world champion. She spoke to Ayeshea Perera about her route to sporting glory. ‘Life Interrupted’ Series Producer: Geeta Pandey Picture: Stephanie Summerville Credit: BBC Show less
