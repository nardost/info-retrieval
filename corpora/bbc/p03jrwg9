A look at the causes of childhood leukaemia. Research appears to show that low doses of radiation could lead to the illness but the findings are inconclusive because some individuals appear to be more sensitive to it than others. Also in the programme, how archaeologists have rediscovered the tomb of Rameses II in the Valley of the Kings and the tiny scanning microscope that probes the secrets of superconductors.
