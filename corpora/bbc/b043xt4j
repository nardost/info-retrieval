No million-dollar campaigns, no shocking TV ads, no buttons or bows. No wonder Americans envy the British election system. This archive edition of Letter from America was recorded by one of two listeners, who between them taped and labelled over 650 Letter From America programmes from 1973 to 1989. It was restored by the BBC in 2014. Show less
