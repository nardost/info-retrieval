This week The Forum is at the London School of Economics as part of their Space for Thought Festival 2014, and weâ€™re playing it for laughs, with a little heart-ache thrown in. Tim Marlow is joined by award-winning writers Tracy Chevalier and Daniyal Mueenuddin, who both read from their most recent work; and by neuroscientist and part-time stand-up comedienne Professor Sophie Scott, who explains why and how we laugh. We also hear the views (and the giggles) of an international audience in the Sheikh Zayed Theatre. Photos by Nigel Stead Show less
