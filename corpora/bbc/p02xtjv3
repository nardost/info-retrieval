Last winter, two dead bodies were washed up on the shores of Norway and the Netherlands, both wearing identical wetsuits. The police were unable to identify the men. But Norwegian journalist Anders Fjellberg from the newspaper Dagbladet, and photographer Tomm W. Christiansen, decided to start their own investigation. They uncovered an astonishing story. The killing of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe has raised again the issue of how to protect Africa's wildlife. Two men have been charged with poaching, which remains a big challenge for conservationists across the continent. In Rwanda, for example, a former park ranger has come up with a novel solution. Edwin Sabuhoro is literally turning poachers into gamekeepers - in his case to protect the endangered local gorillas. Judith Wambura is better known under her stage name Lady Jaydee. She's one of the biggest musical artists in Tanzania and is hugely popular across East Africa. She's won many awards for her songs about life and the people around her. The BBC's Andrea Kidd went to meet her at her home in Dar es Salaam. The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan used to have the worst football team in the world - ranked at 209 out of 209.
