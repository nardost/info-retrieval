Punk rockers have a reputation for not sticking to the rules, for having an anarchic tendancy. But Gilles Bertin was in another category altogether. A big name on the French punk rock scene in the 1980s, he became better known for his crimes, and the decades he spent on the run. A few months ago, he finally stood trial for an armed robbery he'd committed nearly three decades earlier. He's been telling Outlook's Harry Graham about his remarkable life. Before last year, Iranian Majid Adin didn't really know much about the British singer Elton John - but now he thanks him for changing his life. Majid fled Iran and travelled across Europe before getting into Britain by hiding in a refrigerated lorry, but it was when Majid went in for a competition to create a video for the song Rocket Man by Elton John, that his life changed completely. Majid did some sketches and ended up winning. He tells Jo Fidgen his story. Greg Louganis is one of the most celebrated divers in the US, and a record-breaking athlete. But Greg is also famous for one of the biggest shocks in Olympic history â€“ it all began with a disastrous dive at the 1988 Olympics. (Image: Gilles Bertin.
