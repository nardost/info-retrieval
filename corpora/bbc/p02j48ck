Sister Rosemary Nyirumbe is a Catholic nun who supports girls who were victims of the Lord's Resistance Army, which terrorised the people of northern Uganda for over 20 years. Sister Rosemary restores the girls' self esteem and gives them a career by teaching them sewing at the Saint Monica Girls' Tailoring Centre in Gulu, Uganda. When Jean Jude was a child growing up in France he was told that his family couldn't afford a piano. So he secretly saved up his pocket money to pay for piano lessons. That childhood passion ended up taking over his life. Not only did he become a music teacher, but he started collecting pianos. Now he has over 180 instruments and has turned his home in the city of Tours into what he calls a "piano orphanage". The singer songwriter Joan Armatrading has been known for the raw emotion of her music ever since Love and Affection made her an international star in 1976. Joan Armatrading was born in St Kitts in the Caribbean, but moved to Birmingham in the UK when she was seven years old. Now, after 20 albums and 42 years on stage Joan says her current world tour will be her last. It is also the first in which she's performing completely alone on stage, with no backing band. "Lucian" is a homeless man from Romania who won the lottery in Sweden. Two months ago he was begging and living on the streets. Then he bought a scratch card and won a car. He was able to trade it in for 210,000 Swedish Krone - about 25,000 US dollars - in cash. And now he's moved back to Romania to rejoin his family. Show less
