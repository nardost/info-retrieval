In March 2016, a young married couple were attacked by a gang in broad daylight on a busy street in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The woman, Kausalya Shankar, was injured but managed to get away, her husband died on the way to hospital. The court case that followed shocked the country because it revealed a powerful story of forbidden love, and prejudice and exposed the astonishing determination of the woman who was widowed. Iris Apfel is 96 years old and is considered one of the most stylish women in New York City. Her signature look is oversized glasses, bold colours, and layers of hefty jewellery hanging from her neck, arms, ears, lapels... As she told Outlook's Saskia Edwards, her style has been likened to jazz music. In the 1990s, Guy Chambers was just another struggling songwriter living in London when he got a life-changing call. It turned out that Robbie Williams, one of Britain's biggest popstars, wanted to work with him. Within days, they'd written one of the most iconic songs of the '90s. Outlook's Emily Webb went to meet Guy to hear the story. (Picture: Kausalya Shankar. Credit: Nathan G.) Show less
