Carrie Gracie's award winning series on White Horse Village returns with this two-part documentary. She tackles one of the biggest stories of our time, the urbanisation of China. Over the course of several years - Carrie has charted the transformation of a small mountain village - a thousand miles from Beijing, as it is destroyed to make way for 21st Century China. Overcoming barriers of language and culture, the story is told through the voices of those experiencing the urban revolution and discovers how they are adjusting. It also meets those who've moved into this new city - working in the shops and restaurants - that have opened where once there were rice paddies. Show less
