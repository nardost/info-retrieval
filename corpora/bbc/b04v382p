Laura Bates, journalist and curator of the Everyday Sexism Project, explains to Matthew Parris why the 19th century children's author Louisa M. Alcott has her vote for a Great Life. They are joined by Sarah Churchwell, Professor of American Literature at the University of East Anglia. Louisa May Alcott is best known as the writer of Little Women, the story of four sisters growing up during the Civil War in America. Generations of girls have read the book, which at first sight seems to be an improving tract on growing up and becoming good Christian wives. Both Laura and Sarah have a very different reading of the book and believe Louisa M. Alcott to have been a remarkable woman and a dedicated feminist. Producer Christine Hall. Show less
