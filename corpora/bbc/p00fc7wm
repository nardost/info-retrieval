AATISH TASEER In January of this year the Governor of Punjab in Pakistan, Salman Taseer, was shot dead by one of his own bodyguards. He had been a high profile campaigner against Pakistan's blasphemy laws. News of the murder provoked many different emotions in his estranged son, novelist Aatish Taseer. He was brought up in India by his mother and didn't meet his father until he went to Pakistan to seek him out when he was twenty one. He tells Matthew Bannister about his Indian childhood, meeting his father for the first time and their difficult relationship. Aatish Taseer's his latest novel The Temple Goers is published by Viking. ORA GARWAY Ora Garway is the only female newspaper editor and publisher in Liberia. She set up the tiny paper "Punch" with a mission to tackle the big stories in a country still recovering from civil war. Despite the fact that Liberia has Africa's first woman president, Ora says most women working in journalism there are sidelined and reduced to re-writing press releases. She tells Outlook how she was inspired by her father to become a journalist and about the stressful long hours she had to work when she launched Punch. Show less
