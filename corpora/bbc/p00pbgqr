Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, we meet a Syrian doctor who risks torture - and even death - for treating wounded pro-democracy activists in secret clinics, set up in neighbourhoods where demonstrations take place. Also, we hear from British identical twins, Dan and Michael Smith, who suddenly lost their sight within a few months of each other. They tell Lucy Ash how they are coming to terms with their condition. And, as part of our Edible City series in which we talk to people who live in London and keep in touch with their roots by the food they cook, Robert Kusy shows us how to cook a traditional Polish stew.
