Stories of new beginnings for the New Year. For many years, HIV / AIDS was a taboo subject in the Kingdom of Bhutan.The first case was reported in 1993, and there are still only 403 known cases - but because of the culture of shame and secrecy, the real figure is possibly much higher. But on the 1st January 2011, something very significant happened. A young Bhutanese couple decided to announce to the entire country that they were HIV positive. As a 14-year-old, Matthew Boger was living on the streets of Los Angeles having been kicked out of the family home for being gay. One evening Matthew was attacked by an older boy named Tim Zaal who was a member of a violent gang of Neo-Nazi punk rockers. A chance meeting 26 years later lead to the pair forming an unexpected friendship. Syrian doctor Zizit Abdel Algabbar became separated from her baby daughter as they tried to get a new start in Europe. With no papers, and no money left Zizit didn't know if she would ever see her daughter again. Finally one of the strangest journeys ever undertaken: In 1964, athlete Reg Spiers was training in London when he became injured. He was desperate to get home to Australia, but he didn't have any money - so he decided to post himself in a box with the help of his English friend, and fellow javelin-thrower, John McSorley.
