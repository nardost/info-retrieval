HIKIKOMORI Up to a million adolescents in Japan have been labelled ‘hikikomori’ because of their predilection for withdrawing from social life and cutting off relationship outside the family for periods in excess of six months. Professor Andy Furlong, Deputy Head of the Department of Management at the University of Glasgow, has been researching this phenomenon and wrote about his findings in a recent article entitled The Japanese Hikikomori phenomenon: acute social withdrawal among young people - published in the Sociological Review. WOMEN’S ANTI-SUFFRAGE Julia Bush, Senior Lecturer in history at the School of Social Sciences, University of Northampton, is the author of a new book Women Against the Vote; Female Anti Suffragism in Britain. Laurie Taylor is joined by Julia Bush and Joanna Bourke, Professor of History at Birkbeck College, to talk about the Anti Suffrage Movement. They discuss the lives and historical legacy of the women who actively campaigned against the extension of the franchise to females. Show less
