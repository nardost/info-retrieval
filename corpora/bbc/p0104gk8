For years Olga Marina Hernandez had no idea whether her son was alive or dead after he travelled from Honduras with the hope of finding work in the US. But she became one of the few members of the 'Caravan of Mothers' from Central America whose search had a happy ending. We also hear from the Somali woman they call Mama who returned to her home country to help thousands of displaced women and girls. And the London African Gospel Choir are in the Outlook studio performing in Zulu and English.
