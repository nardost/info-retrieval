Pianist Kirill Gerstein chooses the conductor and composer Ferruccio Busoni. Matthew Parris presents. When Busoni died in Berlin in 1924, his pupil Kurt Weill said, "We did not lose a human being but a value." Unravelling exactly what this means is the pianist Kirill Gerstein, a great admirer of Busoni and also a performer of his work. Busoni was a thinker as well as a composer. His book from 1907, Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music, has influenced generations of musicians. The producer in Bristol is Miles Warde. Show less
