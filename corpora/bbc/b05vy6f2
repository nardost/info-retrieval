Val McDermid thinks crime writing is most definitely a suitable job for a woman. She believes women are good at observing the minutiae of life and incorporating them into clue development. Despite writing a book entitled 'An Unsuitable Job For A Woman', PD James evidently thought the same. Val McDermid -who knew and loved the writer who died last November - discusses her life with the help of James' friend, the literary critic Peter Kemp. Producer: Maggie Ayre. Show less
