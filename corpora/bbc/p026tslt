In 2004, photographs showing Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib jail in Baghdad being humiliated and abused by their American guards, sent shockwaves around the world. Ten years on, American fashion photographer Chris Bartlett is exhibiting portraits of the former detainees that show them in a very different light. Charles Aznavour is one of France's most popular singers and known for his unique voice. Now 90 years old, he's written and recorded more than 700 songs - and has just released an album of his greatest hits sung in English. Rola el-Halabi's family fled to Bavaria from their home in Lebanon during the civil war of the 1980s, but the transition was not easy. To try to toughen her up, Rola's step-father took her to the local boxing ring - and she started racking up the titles - until one night when it all went wrong. Our reporter Abby d'Arcy went to meet her. Ackeem Ngwenya grew up in rural Malawi - where many of the roads are so bad that walking is really the only way to get around. So he decided the solution was a new type of wheel. He tells Jo Fidgen what it looks like. (Picture: Photographer Chris Bartlett with some of his Abu Ghraib pictures. Credit: Stefan Falke) Show less
