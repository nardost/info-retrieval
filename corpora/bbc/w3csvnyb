Poet and journalist Wana Udobang travels round her home city, Lagos, speaking to people who are lonely and isolated in Africa's most populous city. She meets a young gay man who opens up about his feelings of isolation in the light of strict laws on homosexuality, and meets a group of displaced women who are coming together to combat loneliness in poverty. She also hears moving stories about the impact of depression and grief on loneliness, and visits a cycling club and an elderly community centre helping people to feel less lonely in this fast-changing city.
