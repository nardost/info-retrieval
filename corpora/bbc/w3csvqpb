When Nice Leng'ete was eight years old, she was to be circumcised. Then, according to Maasai tradition, she would be a woman and ready for marriage. But she begged her grandfather to postpone and set about persuading the village elders to drop the practice. Hong Nanli is a 79-year-old photojournalist, grandmother and a bit of a celebrity in China where she lives and has been working for the last 40 years. Ahmad Algohbary was 22 when the conflict in Yemen started leaving thousands dead and millions starving. He hadn't planned on getting involved, but when his friend was killed in an airstrike Ahmad decided to start saving young children who have been impacted by the conflict. We spoke to Mokhtar Alkhanshali a few months ago, he comes from a family of coffee farmers from Ibb province in Yemen. As a boy Mokhtar would help pick the coffee cherries in his school holidays. In high school, he was interested in politics, and planned to become a lawyer. That was until he tried his first really decent cup of coffee. Image: Nice Leng'ete Credit: Anja Ligtenberg Show less
