In 2010 Hera McLeod had a baby with a man called Joaquin Rams. Joaquin came across as a charming person, but things between them turned sour really quickly. After they separated, Hera got legal custody of their son, Prince. Despite that, Rams was granted unsupervised access to the baby. During one of these visits Rams killed 15-month-old Prince. Hera told Emily Webb how she used her grief and anger to become an advocate for child protection. Amah Ayivi is a style guru who sells vintage clothes in Paris.
