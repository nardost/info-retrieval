In this concluding part, Alvin Hall explains how gospel became a global force in popular music. He reveals how Aretha Franklin’s pop success introduced the gospel world to an international audience. He looks at the rise of the gospel choir in the 1970s and 80s and discovers how this religious music increasingly became a money-making industry. He also meets up with leading gospel stars Kirk Franklin and Donnie McClurkin questioning whether they think today’s gospel stars have been affected by money and celebrity.
