Devil or Popular Hero? As President Ahmadinejad steps down, we assess his legacy. Since his election in 2005, Mr Ahmadinejad has challenged his country’s Supreme Leader and goaded the United States. He has become perhaps the most well-known Iranian politician since the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini. This documentary looks at the rise of Ahmadinejad and explains how this provincial politician with a PhD in traffic management came to take on his country’s ruling clerics.
