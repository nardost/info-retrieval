Paul Mben is a journalist who risked his life by travelling to the Islamist-controlled North of Mali to report on the effect Sharia law is having on local people. Matthew also talks to Refilwe Modiselle, a 26-year-old from South Africa who was born with albinism, a condition characterised by a complete lack of pigment in the skin and hair. She is challenging the prejudice often held against people with this condition by becoming a successful fashion model. And we go in search of jaguars in the wetlands of Western Brazil with a former farmworker turned conservationist. Image: Outlook presenter Matthew Bannister Show less
