In 2012 Australian film-maker Anna Broinowski was given unprecedented access to North Korea's film industry when she was allowed to spend three weeks with the country's top directors and actors. The Communist country's regime uses film as a propaganda tool to indoctrinate the population about the decadence of other countries so the cinema industry is very important. Anna has now written a book and made a film about the experience. The Scottish musician Dame Evelyn Glennie was the first person to have a career as a full-time percussion soloist. She has won numerous awards for her performances but what is so remarkable is Evelyn is profoundly deaf - and has been since the age of 12. Speaking to the BBC's Andrea Kidd, Evelyn reveals how she hears music through vibrations. Maria Marte is known as the 'kitchen Cinderella'. These days she is a major figure in Spanish haute cuisine, but just a decade ago she was washing dishes as a newly arrived immigrant from the Dominican Republic The BBC's Guy Hedgecoe went to meet Maria in Madrid.
