On the anniversary of the Smolensk air crash, writer and historian Adam Zamoyski examines how Polish politics and society have been affected by the events of 10 April 2010, a day on which Poland lost its President and 95 others, which included many talented public servants and dignitaries. In the second programme, Zamoyski travels to Warsaw to examine how the legacy of the crash has impacted on a year of Polish politics. The disaster forced Poland to embrace the shortest presidential campaign in its history – with the late president’s identical twin Jarosław Kaczyński of the Law and Order Party running against Bronisław Maria Komorowski of Civic Platform. In the months that followed, deep ideological divisions have developed in the country, and Zamoyski hears the opinions of politicians, students and members of the influential Catholic church.
