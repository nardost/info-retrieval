Among the horrors perpetrated at the Auschwitz camp were crude unscientific experiments conducted on Jewish twins. They were masterminded by the notorious Josef Mengele, known as 'the Angel of Death'. He was a true believer in the Nazi creed about the alleged genetic shortcomings of Jews. Survivors of his brutal regime have spoken to the BBC about their experiences. They include Yona Laks who was deported to Auschwitz with her twin sister from the Lodz ghetto in Poland at the age of 14, and Vera Kriegel who arrived at the camp when she was just six.
