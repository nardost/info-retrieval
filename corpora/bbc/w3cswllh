Dutee Chand is a top Indian sprinter, the fastest woman in India. However, four years ago, officials gave her some shocking news that brought her world crashing down. They told her she had a very high level of testosterone, and that she could no longer compete as a woman. Dutee fought and won a landmark hyperandrogenism case that has shaped the rules of international athletics. New York is often at the cutting edge of new developments in culture and communications. But in a little corner of the city there's a place where technology from the past is proudly displayed. Chi Tien Lui is a man who is passionate about vintage TV sets. He not only makes them his career, but also his art. Our reporter Tara Gadomski has been to investigate. Lewis Hine certainly isn't your average teenager. When he was just 17 months old, he was diagnosed with a brain tumour and wasn't expected to survive, but he's never given up. Although he's had over thirteen surgeries and been told he could die at any moment, he still remains completely positive. Not only did he organise a mega-prom for teenagers like him who have missed a lot of school due to illness, but he's also set up his own charity to help other children. Lewis has written a book called 'Looking At The Stars'. Image: Dutee Chand Credit: AFP/Getty Images Show less
