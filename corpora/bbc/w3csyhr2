Hiba is a feminist revolutionary from Syria. When the conflict started in 2011, she would encourage women to take a stand against the Assad regime and hid a camera under her veil to film atrocities. Hiba told Jo Fidgen that her defiance is inspired by her heroine, British author Virginia Woolf. In April 1997 a woman dressed as a nurse walked into a Cape Town hospital and left with a newborn baby. The baby's name was Zephany Nurse but she was raised by the woman who kidnapped her as Miche Solomon. It would be 17 years before she discovered her true identity and was forced to make some impossible decisions. Miche recently released a book based on her remarkable life story called: Zephany, Two Mothers One Daughter. (Photo: Poster of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.
