In December 2018, 33-year-old Patricio Manuel made history when he became the first professional transgender boxer in the United States. He won his debut match in California in a unanimous judges’ decision. This was far from Pat’s first time in the ring though. He told Emily Webb about his very successful career in women's boxing. The hairstyles of Chilean footballers can be quite spectacular. Arturo Vidal, who plays for the Spanish club Barcelona, has a spiky mohawk with patterns shaved into the remaining hair. Many other players from the country have followed suit. The person who creates these looks is a man they call Jota Master Barber. He's the official barber for the Chilean team and travels around the world to make sure his clients look suitably slick. Outlook's Jane Chambers went to meet him at his salon in the coastal town of Talagante. In 1974, Australian concert producer Robert Raymond got the gig of his life – organising the comeback tour of his musical idol, Frank Sinatra. The anticipation in Australia was huge and the tour sold-out immediately. But when his opening night performance caused a scandal, Sinatra found himself caught in a stand-off… and Robert Raymond had the biggest test of his career – how to get Sinatra back on stage?
