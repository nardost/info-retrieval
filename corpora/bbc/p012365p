Sixteen year old Phiona Mutesi grew up in the slums of the Ugandan capital Kampala. A chance meeting with a missionary who has a passion for chess changed her life forever. She's now playing chess at an international level and her story is being made into a Hollywood film. Also, the O'Toole family from North Carolina - all five of them have been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. And, The Choir With No Name - the choir giving London's homeless a musical chance.
