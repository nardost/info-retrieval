Keiko and Rex Ziak have made it their mission to reunite families with Good Luck Flags belonging to fallen Japanese soldiers. So far, they've located more than 700 and have returned over 200 flags through the OBON Society that they set up. We're also heading to Brazil to meet the so-called 'queen of football' Marta Vieira da Silva who has been named Fifa Female World Player of the Year five times. Our reporter Irene Caselli spoke to the legend who's trying to encourage more girls to get on the pitch. The report is part of 'A Girls' Game' - a project run by the European Journalism Centre. How big a part of your identity is your voice? Michelle L Myers from Arizona in the US hadn't really thought about it - until her accent changed unexpectedly. She went to bed with a headache and woke up speaking in a new way. Michelle has a rare condition that means her accent can change from day to day.
