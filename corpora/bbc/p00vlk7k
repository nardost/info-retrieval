Extraordinary personal stories from around the world: today, Matthew speaks to a Cambodian man who was sold into slavery in Thailand and forced to work on a fishing boat in appalling conditions. He escaped to Malaysia only to be trafficked again. Plus, the Malawian woman who set up a school for AIDS orphans in her family home - she joins us with two of her students who've been singing to thousands of people in London's pre-Olympics music festival.
