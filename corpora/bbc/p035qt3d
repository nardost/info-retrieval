Satish Kumar was a young man in India in the early 1960s, a period dominated by the threat of nuclear war. He decided to undertake his own, rather ambitious, peace effort - to visit the leaders of all four major nuclear powers to ask them to disarm. That would mean covering a mammoth 8,000 miles, which he chose to do on foot. Sarah Cecilie Finklestein Waters grew up on the run with her father. She was only four years old when her father abducted her from her home in Norway and took her to the USA. With the help of the charity PACT Sarah has now made a film about her experience. Khaled Moustafa grew up in Syria, but now lives in the Swedish capital, Stockholm. One night he received a desperate call from his sister, Fatma, who was in a boat travelling from Turkey to Greece with her husband and their three very young children. It had started to sink. The only clue to her whereabouts was the signal from her mobile phone. The real life story of the Chinese ballet dancer Li Cunxin reads like the script for a Hollywood movie. Li was one of 7 brothers, born in 1961 into an illiterate peasant family in a remote farming community in North Eastern China. He was plucked from his school to attend Madam Mao's Beijing dance academy and became a renowned ballet star. His dramatic defection to the USA in 1979 caused an international incident.
