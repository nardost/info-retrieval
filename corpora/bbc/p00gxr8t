Dr Steve Jones, Reader in Genetics at University College, London gives a series of lectures on the new biological insight into humanity. In his third lecture, Dr Jones explores the power and consequences of natural selection. Differences in animals' physical characteristics vary according to longitude.

Dr Jones explains how selection works and argues that there is less chance of it in modern Western societies than even a century ago. Show less
