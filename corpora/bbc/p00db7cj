From living on the streets to attending Harvard Liz Murray was brought up in New York in the Bronx, by parents who were both drug addicts. From an early age she and her sister had to learn to fend for themselves. Liz's education suffered terribly and by the age of sixteen she was sleeping on park benches and in subways. Although she seemed destined to become just another tragic statistic, by the time she was twenty she was a student at Harvard - one of America's most prestigious universities. She tells Lucy Ash about her remarkable life. Breaking Night: A Memoir of Forgiveness, Survival, and My Journey from Homeless to Harvard is published by Century. Show less
