Clint Hill was assigned bodyguard to American First Lady Jackie Kennedy from 1960 to 1964. On the day that President John F Kennedy was shot, Clint was riding in the car immediately behind the President and his wife. He leapt onto the car to try to protect the President from the bullets but was unable to save him. In an amazing and moving interview, Clint tells Matthew Bannister how his inability to save President Kennedy has haunted him for fifty years. Picture: Jackie (2nd left) and President John F.
