The Islamist movement in Turkey is not revolutionary, it does not decry the United States and it is not opposed to Turkey's liberal capitalist state. In fact, it forms the democratically-elected government of that country and has done since 2002. Laurie Taylor discusses an in-depth study which analyses how and why the Islamic movement in Turkey transformed itself into a pillar of the state, and asks whether the process could work in other Muslim countries. Also, Richard Reeves joins Laurie to discuss the latest research into what it takes to get a decent job in Britain these days. Show less
