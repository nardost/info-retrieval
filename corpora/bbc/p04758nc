As a church minister, Pastor Lorraine Jones is used to helping those affected by gang violence. But in 2014 she experienced it first hand when her son Dwayne was stabbed to death. She has now taken over the running of a boxing gym that Dwayne had set up to keep kids out of gangs. At 12 years old Lucas Retamales went completely blind. He is now aiming to become a world champion surfer. Jane Chambers met him in training at the coastal town of Con Con in Chile. Abdul Matin Malekzada is a potter from Afghanistan who had to flee his village when the Taliban came to destroy it. He is now part of a major movement working to revive the country's traditional crafts. Photo: Pastor Lorraine Jones who runs boxing gym 'Dwaynamics' Credit: Malachi Simpson. Show less
