Why do we bathe? The second of two programmes examining the rituals of bathing. Last week: spiritual purification and supernatural waters. Do you enjoy a hot bath or is water too precious where you live to bathe in? This week is about cleansing the body and clearing the mindâ€¦ water, health and well-being. All of our programmes are available by clicking on the Free Downloads services. (Image: A Japanese woman takes a bath in a natural hot spring, in Nagano Prefecture, Japan.
