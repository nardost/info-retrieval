With a staggering one billion people undernourished, and a growing world population, how do we manage these essential resources for life to make sure there is enough to go round? Bridget Kendall is joined at the European Development Days in Brussels by Rwanda’s top agriculture official Ernest Ruzindaza, whose ministry has been credited with turning a food deficit into a surfeit in just five years. Also on the panel, EuropeAid’s Jean-Pierre Halkin, African Soil Atlas collaborator Luca Montanarella and WaterAid’s Girish Menon.
