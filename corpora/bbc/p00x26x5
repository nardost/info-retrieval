Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, we hear from a Danish surgeon just back from treating wounded people in a makeshift hospital in Syria; an Indian father and son who have saved dozens of lives by diving in to Delhi's waterways and an American photographer who takes extraordinary aerial pictures with the help of his custom-built paraglider.
