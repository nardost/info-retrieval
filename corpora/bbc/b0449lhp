Arianna Huffington, the founder of the online magazine The Huffington Post, talks to Anne McElvoy about the quality of life beyond money and power. Her book Thrive outlines a new way of defining success which she calls The Third Metric. Also, looking at stress in business and the nature of leadership, are the Deputy Chairman of Saatchi and Saatchi Worldwide, Richard Hytner, and Kerrie Fleming, Director of The Ashridge Leadership Centre. Richard's book Consiglieri: Leading from the Shadows considers the role of the second in command in an organisation. Anne talks to author Zia Haider Rahman whose debut novel In the Light of What We Know contains elements of his own Bangladeshi background, a scholarship to Oxford and time spent as an investment banker on Wall Street. And Anne pays tribute to the late Maya Angelou's influence and humour. Show less
