Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, Matthew Bannister talks to Sam Granillo, a survivor of the Columbine High School shootings which took place in the USA back in 1999. Sam lost three of his close friends in the Columbine shootings and he tells Matthew how his traumatic memories came flooding back when another of his friends was killed in the recent cinema shootings in nearby Aurora. Also today, we hear from Vincent Seemi, a former criminal in South Africa who has turned his life around and now acts as a mentor to orphans. He is part of the Father-A-Nation initiative, which was set up to help the thousands of households headed only by children in the country. Show less
