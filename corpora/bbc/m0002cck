Gilet jaune and novelist Edouard Louis, food expert Fabio Parasecoli, journalist, Gavin Mortimer and the historians Jerry White and Joanna Marchant with Philip Dodd. Whether its Berlin, Moscow or the Paris of the gilet jaunes - streets play a vital role in our history and culture. They're focal points of celebration and of protest; they're gathering places for the young and old; places for a promenade or for flanerie; they're where the homeless build makeshift shelters and where musicians busk: they're also where we refresh our jaded palates; they are by definition, theatrical. Yellow vest and novelist, Edouard Louis is the author of Who Killed My Father, The End of Eddy and History of Violence. Historian Jerry White is the author of London in the 18th Century: A Great and Monstrous Thing Joanna Marchant is head of Widening Participation at King's College, London Fabio Parasecoli is Professor in the Department of Nutrition and Food Studies at New York University.
