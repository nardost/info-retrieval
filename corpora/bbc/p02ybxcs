Why has one of the world’s largest banks, HSBC, closed the accounts of a number of British Muslim individuals and charities? The account holders were told only that the bank did not have the "risk appetite” to handle their money. Could the mysterious closure of these accounts have anything to do with the links some of their holders have to the Muslim Brotherhood movement or to charities working in Gaza? Did any government influence the bank’s decision? Journalist Peter Oborne knows some of the account holders affected. In this programme he investigates why the HSBC decided it no longer wanted them as customers. (Image: Peter Oborne) Show less
