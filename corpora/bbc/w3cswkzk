Ashok Alexander was working for a global management consultancy company when he was headhunted to try to avert India's looming HIV crisis. He started working with sex workers in an attempt to address the epidemic. Soon, he discovered these women had amazing leadership qualities that he had never encountered in his boardroom life. They helped him not only address the issue but he also says they made him a better person. Ashok has written a book about his work called A Stranger Truth. What makes a civil rights lawyer quit her job to run a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich cafe? Emily Hunt Turner set up All Square, whose motto is: 'Don't judge, just eat', and employs only people who have a criminal record. Outlook's Nancy Rosenbaum dropped by the cafe in Minneapolis. Klepetan and Malena are Croatia's most beloved couple. They are storks who have lived on the rooftop of Stjepan Vokić's house in the village of Brodski Varoš for the past 16 years. But when Klepetan flies to Africa for the winter, it is Stjepan's job to cheer Malena up while her husband is away. Outlook's Marta Medvešek has been finding out what that involves.
