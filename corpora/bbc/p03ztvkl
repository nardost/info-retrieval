Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists. The situation is particularly bad in the southern state of Veracruz. At least 14 journalists have been killed there since 2010. Moises Sanchez was one of them. For over 30 years, Moises had published his own homemade newspaper called La Union, which reported on local politics in his home town of Medellin. After Moises was brutally murdered in January last year, his son Jorge decided to keep La Union in print. For the young Afghan director Shahrbanoo Sadat, making her latest film was far from straightforward. Because of the conflict in Afghanistan, she was forced to move her cast of non-professional actors through Taliban-held territory to Tajikistan to complete the project. Her film, called Wolf and Sheep, is a portrait of life in the remote village where she grew up. It has just won her a major prize at Europe's top film festival. As a young man, Paul Midden began training to be a priest. But before he was ordained, he changed his mind and instead he studied psychology. He went on to become one of the leading counsellors to Catholic priests in America. One of the main issues he deals with is priests who have been unable to keep their vow of celibacy.
