Kimberley Motley is the American lawyer who represented the family of Farkhunda, the Afghan woman who was beaten to death in broad daylight by a mob, after she was falsely accused of burning the Koran. As the first and only foreign lawyer who litigates in Afghanistan, Kimberley's story is documented in the film Motley's Law. She tells Jo Fidgen why she was initially reluctant to take on Farkhunda's case. Nandita Das is an Indian actor and social activist known for taking on films that ask difficult questions, and expose taboos. She talks about her work and role as one of four judges in Outlook Inspirations - our hunt for the world's inspiring stories (closing date for nominations 1 May 2016). Also, novelist Bonnie-Sue Hitchcock on bringing up four teenagers on an Alaskan fishing boat. Plus, a day in the life of Radio La Colifata - the station broadcasting in Argentina's largest psychiatric hospital. (Photo: Kimberley Motley at work. Credit: Motley's Law) Show less
