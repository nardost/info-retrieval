This is the story of two women, one rich, one poor, as they navigate their way through the global fashion industry. One is a wealthy textile manufacturer from Bangladesh, who employs 11,000 garment workers. The other is a young Cambodian girl who grew up on a garbage dump in Phnom Penh. Five years ago she could neither read nor write. Now she is turning into a charismatic role model for the kids who still live on the dump and is dreaming of becoming a fashion designer. Rubana Huq and Sreymom Ang come from dramatically different backgrounds, but they have one thing in common – their love of fashion. The pair met in London last November at the BBC’s 100 Women event, which brought together dynamic women from across the world. Rubana, the textile magnate, was gripped by Sreymom’s determination to establish herself as a fashion designer. She travels to Cambodia to discover where she came from and then the pair return together to Bangladesh, accompanied by reporter Ilona Vinogradova. Along the way, they learn together about living and working conditions in both countries and what it takes to establish oneself in the fast-moving cut-throat world of international fashion. Can Sreymom realise her dreams? What will Rubana discover about herself and her own motives? Whose life is just about to change once and for all? (Photo: Sreymom Ang (left) and Rubana Huq) Show less
