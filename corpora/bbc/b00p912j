Laurie Taylor explores the history of clothing behind bars. From broad arrows on prisoners suits in the 19th century to the orange jumpsuits worn by inmates of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, the uniform prisoners wear reflects the regime they are being punished by. Laurie is joined by Juliet Ash from the Royal Collge of Art and Elizabeth Wilson from the London College of Fashion to undress the history of prison clothing and discuss what it reveals about the social cultural and political context of the time. Also in the programme, Paul Sparks from Sussex University discusses the importance of the local pub and the power of the boycott. Show less
