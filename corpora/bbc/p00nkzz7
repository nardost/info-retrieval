English has been the dominant global language for a century, but is it the language of the future in rising South East Asia? In the first of two documentary programmes Jennifer Pak visits Malaysia and Singapore, two countries where colonial ties to the English language are loosening. In Malaysia a renewed emphasis on Malay in schools and in culture is controversial with many parent groups anxious for their children's economic future and those concerned at losing a language that unites across ethnic backgrounds. In Singapore we hear how Mandarin is becoming increasingly important together with the street 'Singlish'. Series Produced by Simon Pitts Show less
