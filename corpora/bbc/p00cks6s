HANS CHARLES: When a massive earthquake struck Haiti on 12th January 2010, the BBC's Mike Thomson was one of the first journalists to report on the devastation it caused. Mike returns to Haiti for Outlook and goes in search of Hans Charles, a young boy he came across who was so badly injured that the doctor treating him feared he would not survive. Hans was eventually flown to a hospital in Miami for emergency surgery, and after months of searching, Mike finally finds him living there. Hans tells Mike about his recovery and Hans' mother Viviane explains why she would find it terribly hard to return to Haiti, where she lost so many members of her family including her three daughters.
