Pedro Algorta was one of sixteen passengers to survive an infamous plane crash in the Andes in 1972. Stranded in the snow-covered mountains for seventy days, the group went to unimaginable lengths to stay alive. Somali student Nasro Dahir Abubakar was on a beach in Mogadishu when militants attacked in January. She and her younger brother hid in the toilet blocks, a decision which saved their lives. A few weeks ago there was a news story about a leopard that had got into a school in Bangalore which was wreaking havoc. A video was put up online showing a man grappling with the leopard. That man was wildlife officer Sanjay Gubbi, who'd been called in to try and catch the leopard and stop people getting hurt.
