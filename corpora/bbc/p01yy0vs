Beaten, starved and forced to miscarry: Michelle Knight talks about how she survived 11 years of 'hell' as a prisoner of Ariel Castro in Cleveland, Ohio. And why she decided to forgive her tormentor. The distinguished Czech writer Ivan Klima reflects on his Crazy Century - from a Nazi concentration camp, to persecution by the Communist government and the euphoria of the Velvet Revolution. Anolyn Lulu, a table tennis player from Vanuatu - an archipelago of more than 80 islands in the South Pacific - tells us about the music that reminds her of home.
