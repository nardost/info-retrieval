Last Broadcast Date: Sun 31 Dec 1978
Gloomy end of year report. Prices rising, Russia worried over the US's turn to China and the Middle East still in turmoil. The sound quality on this recording is variable/poor. This archive edition of Letter from America was recorded by one of two listeners, who between them taped and labelled over 650 Letter From America programmes from 1973 to 1989. It was restored by the BBC in 2014. Show less
