Rafael Lopez is a volunteer rescue worker from Mexico who has been part of the team hunting for survivors in the aftermath of the earthquake which struck Mexico earlier this month.

Brendan Quigley and Derrik Albertelli are two members of the Boston Typewriter Orchestra. With no sheet music, no conductor, and without any conventional instruments the group instead manipulate the noises their typewriters make to create their songs. Loretta Napoleoni is an Italian investigative journalist and terrorism expert. Originally an economist, her life was changed when she was contacted by a childhood friend from prison. The woman was a member of the Red Brigades, a left-wing armed group which operated in Italy in the 1970s and early '80s. Loretta's book Merchants of Men is out now. Evie Prichard suffers from prosopagnosia, or face blindness, a condition which means she is unable to remember the faces of anyone she meets, from complete strangers to her own mother.
