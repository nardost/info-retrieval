Back in November 2016, Chapecoense's football team was riding high. A small club from a small city in Santa Catarina it had taken just six years to rise from the lowest rungs of Brazilian football, to the top league. To cap it all they'd just won a place in the final of the Copa Sudamericana, one of South America's biggest club competitions. But then disaster struck. While flying to the cup final in Medellin, Colombia, the plane they were in crashed, killing almost everyone on board. The club lost most of its first team and support staff, in a tragedy that shocked world football. Now the survivors, and the families of those who died, are still recovering from the catastrophe, but the club's story isn't finished yet.
