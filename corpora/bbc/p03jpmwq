Alan Kasujja explores how the boda-boda - motor cycle taxi - has become a defining cultural and political symbol in Uganda, but one which is also fraught with controversy. For many Ugandans boda bodas are the transport of choice. They are quick and cheap, and can be a vital mode of transport in remote areas. They have also become one of the best ways to make a living in Uganda which has a high rate of youth unemployment. But the motor taxis are also divisive, and a lack of regulation means they are hated by many in the capital Kampala, and outlawed in some other African cities. On the Kenya/Uganda border, Alan discovers the history of boda-bodas, which began as push bikes running between the two countries. Travelling across the country he meets the entrepreneurs at the forefront of the boda business boom, and talks to the drivers making their living from the bikes. He also visits Kampalaâ€™s main hospital, where boda injuries are a growing problem and asks what the future holds for the boda-boda boom.
