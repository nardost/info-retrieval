June Steenkamp's daughter Reeva was killed by Oscar Pistorius on Valentine's Day 2013. Oscar says that it was a tragic accident, and last month he started a five year prison sentence, for the culpable homicide of Reeva. June attended the trial throughout, and has written a book about her experiences called "Reeva - A Mother's Story". Band Aid 30 - Thirty years after the charity song Do They Know it's Christmas hit number one, a new version has been released. The proceeds go to help the fight against Ebola in west Africa. Dame Claire Bertschinger, director of Tropical Nursing Studies at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, inspired Sir Bob Geldof to organise the original Band Aid charity and the Live Aid concert. The northern Iraqi city of Mosul fell to Islamic State in June, bringing the population under the rule of the jihadists. The militants introduced a regime that followed their radical version of Islam, which includes brutal punishments, strict rules for women and intolerance of any dissent. Residents describe what life is like in Mosul since IS took over. Captain Matt Zeller was serving with the US Army in Afghanistan when his life was saved by his Afghan interpreter, Janis Shinwari. Once Matt had been posted back to the States, Janis's own life was threatened by the Taliban. Matt set out to help him. Malawian physics student Mixon Faluweki has invented a device that can charge a cell phone using just pedal power. The invention has got him to the finals of a prestigious global tech innovation prize. (Image: June Steenkamp, Getty Images; Dame Claire Bertschinger, Getty Images; Mixon Faluweki) Show less
