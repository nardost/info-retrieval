Some of the biggest rappers in the world like Kanye West, Chance the Rapper and Stormzy are combining gospel and hip-hop in their music. It is bringing attention to ‘gospel hip-hop’. Gospel and hip-hop are closely related, but the relationship hasn’t always been an easy one. Christian artists making gospel hip-hop face barriers both within the church and within the mainstream music industry - it was either the ‘devil’s music’ or ‘not cool enough’. But now it’s becoming popular, people in the church and the music industry are taking note. Award-winning UK rapper Guvna B has been making faith based hip-hop for the past 10 years and wants to find out what’s behind this shift. He travels to the USA to meet gospel legends Donald Lawrence and Kierra Sheard to hear why they have incorporated R&B and hip-hop into their music since the 1990’s. And he meets gospel hip hop stars Lecrae and Andy Mineo in Atlanta to discuss the issues around mixing faith and hip-hop and the challenges they’ve faced being labelled ‘Christian rappers’. In the UK, Guvna B talks to gospel star Muyiwa Olarewuju and soul singer Samm Henshaw whose single ‘Church’ topped the UK charts. Where will this trend lead? With the norm being explicit, sexualized hip-hop, will Christian artists offering a positive alternative start to be promoted by the music industry? And what about the church – will it fully embrace gospel hip-hop? Presenter/reporter: Guvna B Producer: Miriam Williamson (Photo: Lecrae, Reach Records founder, in concert.
