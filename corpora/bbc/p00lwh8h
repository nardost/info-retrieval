Knitting in Tripoli tells an intimate story of life during the Libyan war through the eyes of people who battled their own fears to step out of Gaddafi's dark shadow. Within days of the uprising, the BBC's Rana Jawad was forced underground, petrified the secret police would come knocking, partly because her husband is from Benghazi. She became the BBC website's Tripoli Witness - and took up knitting and baking to cope with the strains of living in hiding and secretly gathering information. Rana recounts those days, and reconnects with sources whose courage to speak out allowed her to get the story out to the world. She also encounters a whole world she knew little about - Tripoli's underground resistance movement - residents who also lived a double life during those revolutionary days. Show less
