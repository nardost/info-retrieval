London teenager Khadijah Mellah had only been riding for four months when she became the first Muslim woman to win a prestigious British horse race. Despite being the youngest competitor, she rode to victory in the 2019 Magnolia Cup at the world-famous Goodwood Racecourse. After seeing her neighbour killed by a landmine as a child, Fatima Amiri vowed she would one day make her country safe. She is now working as part of Afghanistan's all-female demining team removing explosives that litter her home province. 100-year-old Walter Ferguson is a Costa Rican 'national treasure' known as the country's king of Calypso. In his heyday people from all over the world would flock to hear him sing at his family home, and record his performances on cassette tapes. Now, decades later, his family and fans have started a global search to find those missing cassettes. They tell Outlook's Clayton Conn about preserving the legacy of a master.
