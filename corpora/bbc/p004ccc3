THE FORUM: A World Of Ideas presented by Bridget Kendall. This week: a fresh approach to the Middle-East crisis, the long term effects of radiation on plants and animals and a panoramic look at one year in the life of the Roman Empire...428 AD. Palestinian philosopher and peace-broker SARI NUSSEIBEH tell us why he thinks faith and imagination could be the vital ingredients for solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. British radio-ecologist BRENDA HOWARD explains why thereâ€™s an urgent need for new standards to measure the ecological impact of radio active contaminants...not on humans, but on animals and plants. And Italian historian GIUSTO TRAINA reveals how sometimes the most interesting historical events happen at the margins of empires rather than at the centre. Show less
