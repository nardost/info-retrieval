It is more than 20 years since the Colombian drug baron Pablo Escobar was shot dead in his home city of Medellin. At the height of his powers Escobar was said to be the seventh richest man in the world. And he controlled up to 80% of the world's cocaine trade. His unbelievable wealth and power were only matched by his brutality - he was responsible for thousands of deaths and kidnappings during the '80s and early '90s - a period when when his cartel terrorised Colombia. Given that legacy - the name Escobar is not an easy one to carry. So Pablo's son is now known as Sebastian Marroquin. Sebastian told Outlook what it was like to grow up as the son of one of the world's most notorious criminals. How much would you pay for a hat? $10, $20? How about $25,000? That is how much you would pay for a hat made by the Ecuadorian Simon Espinal. Simon is recognised as one of the world's greatest Panama hat weavers and he spoke to Outlook about the art of hat making and why the famous straw hats made in Ecuador are known as Panamas. Practise makes perfect - everyone knows that, especially when it comes to learning a musical instrument. But one International virtuoso is now claiming that less is more. Christian Tetzlaff is a world famous German violinist. And he is deeply concerned for the millions of children around the world who are being pressurised into practising for hours day in, day out. On the banks of the river Ganges, in the city of Varanas, are 84 huge sets of steps, known as ghats. Over the years these ghats have become increasingly filthy due to industrial waste and being used as public lavatories. Now one woman, Temsutula Imsong has taken it upon herself to lead the efforts to clean them up. (Photo: Sebastian Marroquin) Show less
