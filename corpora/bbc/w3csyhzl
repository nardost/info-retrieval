After Neelam Krishnamoorthy’s children, Unnati and Ujjwal, were killed in a fire at the Uphaar cinema in Delhi in 1997, she and her husband sought to bring those responsible to justice. Two decades on, they have won some small victories, but also suffered many disappointments and delays. Neelam spoke to Aparna Alluri about their ongoing legal battle and the devastating impact the fire has had on their lives. As a young woman Ieva Lesinska was faced with an agonising choice. Defect to the US with her double agent father, or stay in Latvia with her mother and renounce him as a traitor. Ieva spoke to Emily Webb about her life, which she says was like living in a spy movie. ‘Life Interrupted’ Series Producer: Geeta Pandey Photo: Neelam Krishnamoorthy Credit: Mansi Thapliyal Show less
