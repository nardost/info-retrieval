Kooshyar Karimi is an Iranian-Jewish doctor who carried out hundreds of unauthorised abortions on young women who were at risk of punishment for becoming pregnant whilst unmarried. He was arrested and says he was forced to spy on his fellow Jews by Iranian intelligence. Born in the Amazon rainforest, Nixiwaka Yawanawá is a member of the Yawanawá indigenous people from west Brazil. Today, Nixiwaka lives in London and is competing in the city's famous marathon to raise awareness of the problems faced by his tribe and other indigenous people around the world. Actress and writer Danai Gurira describes herself as `Zimerican' because she was born in America, but went to school in Zimbabwe. She talks to the BBC's Kirsty Lang about a play she's written called Eclipsed - a hard-hitting piece based on the real lives of young women caught up in the second Liberian civil war in 2003. Lone Nielsen gave up a glamorous career in Denmark to live among Borneo's apes. She tells the BBC's Kim Chakanetsa how she set up the Nyaru Menteng Rescue Centre in 1999. The place is now home to 600 orangutans, many of whom have been orphaned by the destruction of their forest habitat by illegal logging and plantation. (Photo: Dr Kooshyar Karimi) Show less
