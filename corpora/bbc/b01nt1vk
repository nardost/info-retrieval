Amos Oz, one of Israel's most influential thinkers, gives a talk on the Middle East and the prospect of future co-existence between Israel and Palestine at the Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival. A best-selling novelist, essayist and journalist, Amos Oz is frequently cited as a possible candidate to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Oz's work has been published in 41 languages, including Arabic, and he is known as a prominent advocate of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His books include the semi-autobiographical novel A Tale of Love and Darkness, a portrait of war-torn Jerusalem in the 1950s, and the recent collection of stories Scenes from a Village Life. The event is chaired by Night Waves presenter Philip Dodd and recorded as part of Radio 3's Free Thinking Festival 2012. The Free Thinking festival of ideas takes place at The Sage Gateshead Friday 2 - Sunday 4 November and is broadcast for three weeks on Radio 3 from Friday 2 November. Show less
