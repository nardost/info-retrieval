Free Thinking marks the bicentenary of Anthony Trollope with a programme devoted to his satire, The Way We Live Now. Although savagely reviewed when it first emerged in 1875, the novel has come to be regarded as Trollope's masterpiece - a brilliant and unsettling anatomy of English society with " a vile city ruffian," Melmotte, as its central character. Philip Dodd is joined by Jerry White, Simon Heffer, Kathryn Hughes and Jonathan Myerson to consider the nature of Trollope's achievement and the novel's place in the literary landscape.
