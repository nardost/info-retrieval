Tuy Gentry Buckner was born in war-torn Vietnam in the 70s. His birth mother left him at an orphanage hoping he would have a better life. Tuy contracted polio when he was three, which left him disabled. Life changed for him when he was adopted by an American couple. He had a happy family life with them, but always dreamed of finding his birth mother. When he returned to Vietnam as a twenty year old Tuy met someone who said "I know your Mom". His unexpected journey led him across the world to find his birth family, his roots and his identity. (Image courtesy of Tuy Gentry Buckner.) Show less
