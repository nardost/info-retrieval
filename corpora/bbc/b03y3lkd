On Last Word with Julian Worricker: Clarissa Dickson Wright, one half of the forthright on-screen duo, 'Two Fat Ladies'. Former BBC2 controller, Jane Root, pays tribute to a woman described by many as 'utterly non-PC'. Lord Ballyedmond, who became one of Northern Ireland's richest men, and was a politician at Westminster and in Dublin. Peter Callander who wrote hits for the likes of Cliff Richard, Cilla Black and Dusty Springfield. Mohammed Qasim Fahim, one of Afghanistan's two vice-presidents. The BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, reflects on his role. And the model who became a stylist and then an acclaimed fashion designer, L'Wren Scott. Show less
