Should we be more aware of the space we live in? Where does private space end, and what is it that makes a space public? One of the world's leading art critics TJ Clark explains why Picasso’s use of space is the key to understanding his paintings. The Dutch sociologist and globalisation expert Saskia Sassen speaks in favour of empty spaces - indeterminate areas of a city which people can make their own and populate with their own history. And philosopher of space Stephan Günzel argues that humans are spatial beings above all else, and that an awareness of space is crucial to learn who and what we are. (Photo: Art gallery.
