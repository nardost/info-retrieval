When nine swimmers became caught in a rip tide off the coast of Florida in the USA, 80 people formed a human chain to drag them back to safety. Chang Hsien-liang lost his arm in a factory accident. He's since gone on to develop technology to 3D print a new limb for himself, and also help others. Chris Mears, and his partner Jack Laugher, are the first British divers to win Olympic Gold. But Chris was lucky to even be alive to compete at all following a near-death experience in Australia aged just 16. In Colombia, there's a rock 'n' roll band unlike any other in South America. All except one of the members of 250 Milligrams are transgender men. They're named after the monthly dose of testosterone they each take. One member isn't transgender. In fact, she's the nurse who gives them their hormone injections. (Picture courtesy of Roberta Ursey.) Show less
