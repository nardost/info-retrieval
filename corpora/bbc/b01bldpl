On Start the Week Andrew Marr looks at the state of conservatism. Thomas Frank chronicles the rebirth of right-wing populism in the United States, with the resurgent Tea Party. It's a movement driven by ideology with a vision of utopian capitalism. At home right-wing commentators bemoan the lack of ideology at the heart of the government. Peter Hitchens argues for a political philosophy that stresses a sense of place and history, and decries the Tory Party's shift to the 'centre ground'. The neoconservative Douglas Murray goes further in asserting that military might is vital to defend freedom and justice. But the new MP Margot James follows her party's model of caring capitalism, and its move away from its reputation as the unelectable "Nasty Party". Producer: Katy Hickman. Show less
