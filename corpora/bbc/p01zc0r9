Amanda Lindhout is the Canadian reporter held hostage in Somalia for 15 months with her former boyfriend Nigel Brennan. She was tortured and sexually abused by her captors. She tells us about a dramatic escape attempt, how she used her imagination to survive and how she didn't recognise herself when she first looked in the mirror after being released. She has written a book about her experience called A House in the Sky. Brazilian writer Diogo Mainardi on his unlikely bestseller devoted to his son Tito who has cerebral palsy. His book, The Fall, follows Tito's wobbly steps around the world from Venice to Rio de Janeiro. And meet Sher Singh, one of the Indian postal service's few remaining 'dak' runners who delivers the mail on foot - through forests and mountains, in rain and snow - to reach the farthest-flung addresses.
