In June 2010 Julia Gillard became Australia's first woman Prime Minister. She tells Matthew about the tumultuous three years she spent in office, the famous speech she gave to the Australian parliament accusing the then leader of the opposition of sexism, and what she misses most about being Prime Minister. Her autobiography is called "My Story". When his parents died, Anselmo Arruda inherited a large house in the Brazilian coastal town of Itanhaem. Anselmo was in his early twenties, he was lonely and had no need for so much space. So rather than sell it, he decided to turn the house into a skate park. Today the "cave house" has become a mecca for skateboarders from all over Brazil. British poet Christopher Reid lost his wife Lucinda to cancer 10 years ago. His loss inspired him to write an anthology of poems called "A Scattering". The book became a best seller and won a major literary award - something he thinks his wife would have been very proud of. Italian record producer and DJ Giorgio Moroder created the synthesised electronic dance sounds that made Donna Summer a household name in the 1970s. He's also won three Oscars for his original film soundtracks. He tells the BBC's John Wilson about his first solo album in 30 years "Déjà Vu" which was released this month.
