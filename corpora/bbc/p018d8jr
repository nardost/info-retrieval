Jean Baptiste Ntakirutimana comes from the Tutsi tribe in Rwanda. Although he managed to flee the genocide of 1994, he returned to his homeland to find that his entire family had been murdered. In 2008 he arranged to go to a prison to meet the man who was serving a sentence for killing his mother. He tells Matthew Bannister about the moment he came face to face with this man - and how he was able to forgive him. Also today, we meet Egyptian actor Walid Hammad who dressed as a woman and walked through the streets of Cairo to gauge how much sexual harassment women suffer. We meet the Senegalese wine maker who, as a Muslim, isn't allowed to taste the wine he's made - and Matthew meets the British artist who was inspired by his family's history of disability to capture disabled people in motion.
