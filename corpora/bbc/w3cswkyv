Haya Zahid is one of Pakistan’s top human rights lawyers. She was destined for a glittering and lucrative career in corporate law but threw it all away to help thousands of people who’d suffered miscarriages of justice. Massimo Vacchetta is on a mission to save as many hedgehogs as he can. He decided to open Italy’s first hedgehog hospital after saving a tiny baby orphan hedgehog, named Ninna. He let Ninna go back into the wild, but in the past few months, he's rescued more than 200 wounded animals. His book about Ninna's story is called A Handful of Happiness. When Victoria Arlen was 11 years old, she became unwell with a mystery illness and lost consciousness. She woke up years later to find herself in a hospital bed unable to communicate or move. For months she was alert, but nobody knew it and all she had were her thoughts. (Image: Haya Zahid. Courtesy of Haya Zahid.) Show less
