Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Today, the British man who faked his own death by paddling out to sea in a canoe. John Darwin disappeared in 2002 - and his wife Anne collected a six figure life insurance pay out. Five years later John gave himself up and the couple spent more than two years in prison for their deception. Matthew Bannister speaks to John about his regrets and why he is still paying the price for his crime. Also today, Richard Simpkin, the Australian man who's been photographed alongside more than two thousand of the world's top stars, including Jack Nicholson and Keanu Reeves. Show less
