"Night of the Lovers" is a three hour phone-in radio show for the lovesick teenagers in Afghanistan. It is broadcast once a week on the privately owned station Arman FM. We talk to the show's creator Sameem Sadat. Rene Denfeld is a death penalty investigator in Oregon in the United States. She talks to the prisoners, their families, their victims - to find out why they did what they did, and whether there are mitigating circumstances that could justify commuting the death sentence to a prison term. She has used these experiences as the basis of her first novel The Enchanted. Four farmers from four continents discuss the pleasures and challenges presented by the rural lives that they have chosen: James Rebanks and his family have shepherded in the Lake District for generations; Sandy Martin and his wife Di own a sheep station in South Australia; Aftab Ahmad lost thousands of chickens to disease on his farm just outside Delhi where his crops now include wheat and mustard; American Trey Lewis has a buffalo farm near Baltimore County, Maryland. Khaled Al Saai, the Syrian calligrapher who fled into exile - his graphic art now reflects the destruction of his homeland. Brian Robson, the man who nearly died trying to travel from Australia to Britain in a crate. Show less
