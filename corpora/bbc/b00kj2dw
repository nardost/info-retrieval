Andrew Marr sets the cultural agenda for the week. His guests include Harvard politics professor Michael Sandel, who gives this year's Reith Lectures on A New Citizenship, addressing the 'prospect for a new politics of the common good'. Plus novelist Giles Foden on his new book Turbulence, the developmental psychologist Bruce Hood on why he thinks we all have a 'supersense', the propensity to believe in the supernatural, and astronomer Carolin Crawford on the science and beauty of nebulae.
