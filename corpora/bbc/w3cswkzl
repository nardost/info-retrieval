James Myers survived being shot in the head five times in 2014 and still has three of the bullets lodged in his skull. Though James has managed to keep his sense of humour and a positive outlook, his life hasn’t been the same since the attack. He suffered from memory loss and PTSD. In 2016, his attacker was sentenced to 20 years in jail. Geert Weggen is a wildlife photographer who specialises in squirrels. He doesn't even have to step outside his door to snap them. He lives in a forest in central Sweden, and keeps a camera by the kitchen window, and waits for them to come to him. Hans-Jürgen Topf has been washing and ironing rock stars’ clothes since 1982, when he launched a laundry service for touring artists.
