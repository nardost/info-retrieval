As a boy growing up in Chicago, Norman Malone played the piano. But his dreams of a musical career came crashing down after he and his brothers were horrifically attacked by their father when he was 10 years old. This left him paralysed down his right side, so Norman started to relearn the piano using only his left hand. Now in his late seventies, Norman is finally getting his moment in the spotlight. We get a private water tasting with Michael Masha who says when he takes a bottle of 4000 year old ice-berg water to a party, it goes down much better than an expensive champagne. The Austrian water sommelier explains why he travels around the world tasting water. Indian medical student Vipin Khadse became a hero when he delivered a baby on a packed train. The labour was complicated, but luckily Vipin had a sterile surgical blade and was in Whatsapp contact with his medical training mentors who helped to guide him through the difficult birth. From racehorse to artist, we meet Metro in his stable turned studio, where he paints bright vivid pictures that sell for hundreds of dollars. His owner Ron Krajewski has become Metro's reluctant spokesperson and tells Outlook's Zach Young how the profits from the paintings have gone towards his vet bills and also helping a horse charity.
