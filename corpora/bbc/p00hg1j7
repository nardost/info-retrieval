He delivers six lectures on the wonders of the solar system in his series entitled 'The Individual and the Universe'. In his final lecture entitled 'The Origin of the Universe 2', Professor Bernard Lovell considers the alternative theory which science can offer on the beginning of the universe. His exploration of the continuous creation theory concludes his Reith lectures. Show less
