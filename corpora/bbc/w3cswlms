Mountaineer Rosemary Saal broke barriers by being part of the first all African-American team to climb America's highest mountain when she was 19. Now she’s inspiring young black children to do the same. We meet Finnish pastor Haka Kekäläinen who is introducing heavy metal inspired hymns in his church. He told Outlook's Saskia Edwards what it's like when his metal mass begins. The Iraqi couple who fell in love over sweets, or more specifically, baklava. Baking pastries has been an important part of their journey from Baghdad to California. Outlook's Margot Wohl went to meet them. And memories from Martin Orbidans who was once known as 'The Queen's Pianist' for his role as the official piano player for the British Royal family. He even accompanied Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales on their honeymoon. Image: Climbers from Expedition Denali Credit: Hudson Henry Show less
