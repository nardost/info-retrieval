Sean Fong lost his left arm and right leg in a terrible childhood accident when he was playing on train tracks in Fiji. But that hasn't stopped him from making the most of his life. He's not just a record breaking swimmer - he's also a world champion Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighter. He tells Matthew Bannister about his extraordinary life. Chile has a significant community of people from the Caribbean island of Haiti. Many of them live just outside the Chilean capital Santiago in a place called Quilicura. Haitian Ally Lydiems has become a local success story by giving the people there a slice of home. He's the proud owner of the first Haitian Barbershop in Chile. Jane Chambers has been to meet him. Linda Phillips is transforming the lives of musicians. After her guitarist son took his own life, she decided to set up a suicide prevention centre for musicians in her home city Athens, Georgia. Outlook's Martin Matheny went to find out more. Image: Raz Chan (l) and Sean Fong (r) Credit: Sean Fong Show less
