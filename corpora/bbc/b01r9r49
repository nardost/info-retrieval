An Italian food market - Rachel Black talks to Laurie Taylor about her ethnographic account of Porto Palazzo, one of Europe's largest outdoor markets. She watched and spoke to its vendors, shoppers and passers-by to find out how a multi-ethnic market fosters a culinary culture and social life. Professor Sophie Watson is currently studying street markets and joins the discussion. Also, Guy Cook analyses the language of food and food politics; from baby food labels to organic marketing. How our choices and beliefs about what we eat are influenced by the persuasive power of words. Producer: Jayne Egerton. Show less
