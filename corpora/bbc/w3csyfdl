Abby Stein grew up in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, one of the most gender segregated societies in the world. Abby’s parents considered her their firstborn son but she was adamant that she was a girl. She has written a book about her experiences called ‘Becoming Eve.’ Aged eleven, Dirce de Assis Cavalcanti was called the "daughter of a murderer" by her classmates. Dirce soon found out that her father had indeed killed a man and not just any man but one of Brazil’s celebrated authors. Although he was cleared by the courts, in the court of public opinion Dirce’s dad was condemned and this was something Dirce has grappled with throughout her life. She spoke to Outlook’s Andrea Kennedy. Picture: Abby Stein Credit: Courtesy of Abby Stein Show less
