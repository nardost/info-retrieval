Yazidi student Aido Khiro had to flee to Mount Sinjar when so called Islamic State came to his community. Some of his relatives were killed by IS, but Aido survived and has won a scholarship so he can fulfil his grandma's last wish for him to become a doctor. Örlygur Hnefill Örlygsson is an Icelandic space obsessive who was surprised to discover that American astronauts did their lunar training in Iceland in the 1960s. He felt this story needed to be told so Örlygur opened a museum. Outlook's Saskia Edwards goes to meet him there to find out about Iceland's role in the space missions. Russian engineer Stanislav Petrov is known as the man who saved the world. His death has just been reported and we have dug into our archive to bring you an interview Stanislav did with Jo Fidgen about how he managed to avert nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the United States. Maria With Hoen is a Norwegian cyclist who fell off a steep hillside on Bolivia's notorious "Death Road". She miraculously survived the drop and describes what it was like.
