SPENDING THE HOME People are increasingly considering their home as the main part of their financial future. With house prices on the rise, one third of people are cashing in on their house equity early spending the money in a variety of ways, from holidays, to house improvements, to children's education and even for personal retirement. Susan Smith, Professor of Geography at Durham University, thinks that this shift fundamentally changes what 'home' means to the UK population and talks about the findings of her latest research 'Banking on Housing; Spending the Home'. THE NEW AGE COMMUNITY OF ESALEN Laurie Taylor is joined by Professor Jeffrey Kripal author of Esalen: America and the Religion of No Religion and Eileen Barker,Professor Emeritus of Sociology with Special Reference to the Study of Religion at the London School of Economics to discuss the history of Esalen, its philosophy and the effects it has had on the new age.
