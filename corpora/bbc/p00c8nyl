ANDRE HANSCOMBE On a July morning in 1992, Andre Hanscombe's partner, Rachel Nickell was stabbed to death in a London park. Their two-year-old son Alex was found crying next to her body. It took sixteen years for the murderer - Robert Napper - to be caught. It turned out that the police had been warned about him before Rachel was killed. Andre talks to Jo about bringing up a traumatised child and why he wants compensation and a public apology from the London Metropolitan Police. TANYA AND VERNON The last in our series marking the 25th anniversary of the lifting of the ban on mixed-race marriages in South Africa. We end with the story of Tanya and Vernon Denton who got married in 1986. ELEPHANT POLO For the last 28 years, the elephants in the jungle safari parks of southern Nepal have been more than a tourist attraction: they've also been polo players. Elephant polo started here in 1982 after a conversation in a bar led the owner of a resort and his polo-playing friend to customise special long sticks and try the game out on elephants. Now every year, the World Elephant Polo Championship is held in Nepal. Outlook's Joanna Jolly went along to talk to the people who train these polo-playing pachyderms. Show less
