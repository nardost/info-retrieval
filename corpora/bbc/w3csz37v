A few years ago, Freddy McConnell decided to have a baby. A decision that is a big deal for most, but that is even more complicated for Freddy, because he is a transgender man. Freddy started his transition in 2012. Back then having a baby wasn’t on his mind. But after realising that – biologically – it was still a possibility, Freddy decided to get pregnant. Freddy’s story was told in a documentary called Seahorse: the dad who gave birth. It’s available to watch on BBC iPlayer.
