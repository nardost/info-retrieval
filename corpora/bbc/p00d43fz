Scott Neeson A visit to Cambodia in 2003 changed Scott Neeson's life forever, when he was taken to see children working on the city's biggest rubbish dump. The following year he abandoned his jet-setting lifestyle as a Hollywood executive, and moved to Cambodia to help the children. Romania's 'Queen Witch' Outlook pays a visit to Bratara Buzea, a so-called 'Queen Witch' in Romania, who's threatened to cast spells on ministers behind a recent decision to make witches pay income tax. Witches in Romania have a strong following, particularly in rural areas.

He comes from the indigenous Aymara people, and teaches film students in the city of El Alto. He says his success in "Even the Rain" won't make him forget his roots. Show less
