We've been asking our listeners where they listen to Outlook and we got answers from a doctor in the Australian Outback, a cryptography student in Ghana, an Icelandic commuter and two conservationists in Ecuador. Our programme transcends borders, as do some of our guests on this edition. When Morten Hilmer served in the Danish army, he was sent to join a special force called the Sirius Patrol. They use dog sleds to protect the country's interests on the frozen north-eastern coast of Greenland. He's now a full time wildlife photographer. Malian Lassana Bathily moved to Paris, but as an immigrant and a Muslim he felt like an outsider. Then a traumatic event changed the direction of his life. It would gain him French citizenship and lead President Fran√ßois Hollande to name him as his favourite Frenchman. Jessica Cox was born without arms, but it hasn't stopped her testing the boundaries of what she can achieve. She uses her feet to play the piano, drive a car and even fly a plane. Amy Schrodes, was backpacking around Europe when she became aware of the number of migrants fleeing places like Iraq and Syria. She decided she had to help - and volunteered in Lesbos, where thousands of people were arriving by boat every week. While she was working Amy also got to know the stray cats roaming the island. Then one day, a very different-looking cat appeared. (L) Photo/Credit: Morten Hilmer. (R) Photo: Owner with Dias the cat. Credit: Doug Kuntz. Show less
