Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. All of this week Outlook is broadcasting from Delhi, marking 100 years since the city became the capital of modern India. Today, Matthew Bannister meets Binalakshmi Nepram from North-East India. Now based in Delhi, she has made it her mission to try to curb the violence in her home state Manipur, location of one of the world's longest-running insurgencies where police and the army have been battling separatists for more than 50 years. Matthew also meets Nagma Ali, who was rescued from domestic slavery and is now a teacher at the Mukti Ashram - an organisation which gives shelter to children in a similar situation. And Kailash Satyarthi, founder of the Save the Childhood Movement in India, talks about the thousands of children he has rescued. Show less
