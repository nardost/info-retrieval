The thin line between fact and fiction - the theme for today’s programme - guest presented by Philippe Sands, celebrated barrister and Professor of International Law at University College London. French neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene explains the amazing feat of reading which starts with our eyes splitting each word into thousands of fragments. Award winning Danish writer Carsten Jensen on how his sea faring novel reaches truth with the help of a lie, and how fiction can replace documentary facts. And the Mexican historian of science Jimena Canales on why our perceptions are always a tenth of a second behind the world, and what we should do about it. Decoding sound and meaning when we read and tell stories in a tenth of a second – picture by Emily Kasriel. Show less
