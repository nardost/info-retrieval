Matthew Sweet talks to the painter, Maggi Hambling about Cedric Morris one of British art's lost masters and with Joely Richardson and Melanie Williams, evaluates the impact and legacy of Woodfall Flims - the company that gave Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay and Rita Tushingham their first breaks and introduced us to films such as Look Back in Anger, A Taste of Honey and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner. To round things off he'll also be talking to Daniel Kalder about his fascination with the literary works of politicians such as Lenin, Mao, Hitler and Kim Jong-Un. The BFI is having a season focusing on Woodfall films, which are also being released on DVD. Daniel Kalder's book is published as Dictator Literature in Britain and as The Infernal Library in the US.
