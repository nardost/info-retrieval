In 2014, US mother of four LeeAnne Walters discovered that the tap water in her home in Flint Michigan was poisoning her children - her young twins developed rashes, her daughter's hair fell out in clumps, and the water itself was a brownish colour. LeeAnne became a 'water warrior' and led a campaign to expose the toxic water crisis. Karl-Heinz Martens is a retired postman from Germany who had a very unusual beat - he delivered thousands of letters to a tree known as Bridegroom's Oak. They were love letters, written by people in the hope that a potential partner might read them and reply. When Meg and Elena fell in love, Elena's family couldn't accept that she was gay. The couple took drastic action to be together. It's a story of love, persecution - and a whole lot of saltwater, listen to a longer version here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p066wz8s (Picture: LeeAnne Walters.
