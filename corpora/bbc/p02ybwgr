In 2012 Australian filmmaker Anna Broinowski was given unprecedented access to North Korea's film industry when she was allowed to spend three weeks with the country's top directors and actors. The Communist country's regime uses film as a propaganda tool to indoctrinate the population about the decadence of other countries so the cinema industry is very important. Anna has now written a book and made a film about the experience. It's 20 years on since the Srebrenica massacre, when 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed by Serb forces in July 1995. This year the anniversary was marked by the March of Peace - where 10,000 people walked 120 kilometres in three days, retracing the steps of the Muslims as they fled over the hills, trying to escape their fate. The BBC's Jo Impey reports. In 2001, Malian music manager Manny Ansar founded the Festival in the Desert. It became a celebrated event where African musicians mixed with Western stars like Bono of U2 and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin. The festival was forced to close in 2012 when Islamist extremists took control of Northern Mali and banned all music. Manny had been inspired to start the event by his friend Iyad Ag Ghaly. So he was shocked to discover that Iyad had become the leader of the militant Islamist group Ansar Dine which is still trying to impose its version of Sharia law in Northern Mali. Maria Marte is known as the 'kitchen Cinderella'. These days she's a major figure in Spanish haute cuisine, but just a decade ago she was washing dishes as a newly arrived immigrant from the Dominican Republic. The BBC's Guy Hedgecoe went to meet Maria in Madrid. (Picture: Marching to mark 20 years since the Srebrenica Massacre; and a North Korean film Actress. Credit: Aim High In Creation) Show less
