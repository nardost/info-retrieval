Jungle camp in Calais Last week the French government cleared an unofficial camp, used by migrants trying to cross into Britain from Calais. Known as 'the Jungle' it housed hundreds of migrants living in terrible sanitary conditions. A familiar face in the Jungle was volunteer Sylvie Copyans. She provided a daily hot meal to refugees in Calais. She tells Matthew Bannister why many of the migrants evicted from the camp are already coming back. Living Without Money Daniel Suelo gave up money in the year 2000. He now lives mostly in a cave in Utah, eating food he finds growing wild or scavenging in dustbins. He also writes a blog about his lifestyle. He tells Matthew Bannister why he thinks everyone on the planet should take only what they need. Mementos Conflict and violence often force people to leave their homes and countries in a hurry. If they're lucky, they might be able to take with them an object to remind them of their previous life. Vera Frankl has been speaking to migrants about the mementos they treasure. You can hear the full documentaries, called "memento" in the Friday documentary on the BBC World Service Radio. Show less
