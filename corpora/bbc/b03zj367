1970s America rediscovered through lost recordings of Letter from America, on the 10th anniversary of legendary journalist Alistair Cooke's death. Paddy O'Connell and guests including historian Dominic Sandbrook, Alvin Hall, Ann Treneman and Naomi Shragai will reflect on the personalities and stories of 70s America - from Nixon's resignation, Muhammad Ali to Vietnam and women's lib. The Letter from America programmes featured were taped by two listeners and stored in a cellar, an attic and a fertiliser spreader for nearly 40 years. They were recorded by a dairy farmer from the Cotswolds, and a man from Cornwall, who between them have provided the BBC with over 650 lost Letter from America programmes from the 1970s and 1980s. Music chosen: Alvin Hall - Stevie Wonder, Sir Duke Ann Treneman - Bob Dylan, Forever Young David Henderson - Don Mclean, Colour TV Blues Naomi Shragai - Bruce Springsteen, Born to Run.
