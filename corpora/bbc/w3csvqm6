Erricka Bridgeford has lived in Baltimore all her life. Once a city that thrived on community spirit , things started changing when she was young and over the years Erricka has lost many friends and members of her family to gun violence. Now a mediator Erricka is the driving force behind the Baltimore Ceasefire 365 movement but can a city scarred by violence go a whole weekend without anyone being killed? (News archive from WJZ) Dr Abdulkadir Adan studied to be a dentist in Pakistan but when he returned home to Mogadishu he was shocked by how violent the conflict in Somalia had become and how few ambulances there were. Twelve years ago Dr Adan set up the only free, 24 hour ambulance service for ordinary Somalis and with help from a team of volunteers, has been running the service ever since. Precious objects or artworks are at risk of theft, vandalism, even terrorism in some cases. Protecting them is quite a task. But whose task? Outlook's Alessia Cerantola has been to meet one of those people, an Italian man called Alessandro Goppion who's been given the job of protecting some of the most valuable objects in the world including the Mona Lisa painting.
