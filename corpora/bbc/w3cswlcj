English rugby coach Ben Ryan agreed on the spur of the moment to coach the sevens team in the run up to the Rio Olympics. He trained the team to an Olympic gold medal, Fiji's first. He tells Jo Fidgen how he has now been made a tribal chief in Fiji and is celebrated as a national hero. Ten years ago, Orhan Maslo set up the Mostar Rock School to teach kids who have been divided by the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He told Jo Fidgen about the role music played in his early teens, before the war started and when he was angry with just about everything but found a way to rebel through punk.
