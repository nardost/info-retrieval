Hear the story of a remarkable Ugandan nurse, Cathy Groenendijk. For many years she worked for aid organisations in Uganda, Rwanda, and then in 2006, Sudan. The country had just emerged from a twenty-year civil war that had displaced and orphaned thousands of children - the so-called Lost Boys. But when Cathy went to Juba, she discovered there were many Lost Girls too. They told her distressing stories, stories that changed Cathy's life. When you hear the sound of bagpipes, what do you call to mind? Maybe the craggy Scottish Highlands, and a piper dressed in the traditional tartan kilt worn by Scottish men. Possibly not a Japanese man living in neon-lit Tokyo. Japanese bagpiper Shinji Hamada is out to defy your preconceptions. In the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam, Dr Paul Msemwa created the National Museum and House of Culture - as a place to celebrate traditional and modern Tanzanian culture. Our final story comes from Colombia and will have your head spinning. In December, twenty-seven years ago, two sets of identical twin boys were born in different hospitals. Somehow, they got mixed up and one brother from each set went home with each other, and were brought up as non-identical twins. None of them had any idea that they had an identical brother somewhere out there. Until a chance encounter two years ago. Hear their extraordinary tale. (Picture: Cathy Groenendijk.
