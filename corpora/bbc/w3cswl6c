Bruce Gilden is an American street photographer from New York but he has done projects all over the world. In his recent series - Only God Can Judge Me - he photographed a group of sex workers living under a bridge in Miami. They are all women who remind Bruce of his mum and what happened to her. The small island of Cura√ßao in the southern Caribbean is home to a flock of flamingos. One of them - Bob - was injured in an accident in 2016, and since then he has been living with veterinarian Odette Doest. Bob has also become an ambassador for Odette's NGO, Fundashon Dier en Onderwijs Cariben (FDOC), and helps her raise awareness about protecting the birds' habitat. Fouad Thanoon is a big believer in the power of dance. He thinks it can unite people and help them overcome their differences. As the leader of Iraq's national folk dance troupe he has braved violence and war to keep the group alive. Image and credit: Bruce Gilden Show less
