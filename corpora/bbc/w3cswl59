On the streets of the Kenyan capital Nairobi thousands of children live in extreme poverty. They often have no access to clean water, food or education. Until a few years ago, Brian Ochieng was one of them. But Brian found his way off the street, started a successful career as a chef, and then chose to head back to the streets again. Relatives of people with dementia often describe the sense of losing the person they love as the illness takes hold. That's what happened to Carol Rosenstein from Los Angeles, when her husband Irwin was diagnosed with both dementia and Parkinson’s disease. But Carol discovered that music could bring the spark of joy back to Irwin's face. This inspired her to start a project which has now taken on a life of its own. Outlook’s Joanna Clay has been to meet her. Pieter Tritton is a British man who spent 9 years in an Ecuadorian prison he describes as "hell on earth". He ended up there because he had been running an international drugs operation worth an estimated 6 million dollars, smuggling cocaine from South America into Britain and employing teams of people to work in processing laboratories all over the UK.
