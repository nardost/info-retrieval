Stories of freedom Nadia Murad has a difficult story to listen to, but an important one to hear. She was captured by the so-called Islamic State and forced into slavery, but managed to escape after months of abuse. Freedom isn't just about captivity. It's also about the ability to say and do what you believe. That's what the Moustache Brothers stand for, every day, on a makeshift stage in Myanmar. Most of us are lucky enough to find freedom in the small things like a visit to somewhere new. But American blogger Layne Mosler doesn't even want to be held back by a guide book. When she wants to know where to eat - she just asks a taxi driver. Finally, a man who spent many years trying to free himself from the burden of his horrific past. Reaksa Himm grew up in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge regime. When he was thirteen years old, soldiers came knocking at Reaksa's door, accusing his father of spying for the CIA.
