When South African mother Meta Diphoko took her ex-husband to court for child support payments, DNA tests were carried out on their five children. They would reveal a devastating fact - that one of Meta's sons, Kamogelo, was not her biological child. In her search for the truth, Meta returned to the hospital where Kamogelo was born, and where she had shared a room with another mother who had just given birth. She concluded that they had each been given the wrong babies. Both Meta and the hospital are still trying to trace her missing son - he would have just celebrated his 21st birthday on 14th August. Meanwhile Meta continues to be a doting mother to Kamogelo, as Mpho Lakaje has been finding out. John Luther Adams is a Pulitzer Prize winning composer and nature enthusiast from the US who has found an unusual niche in the orchestral world - he composes music inspired by natural landscapes.

Sarah Dodd and Sharan Gill are a married couple from London. They have very serious jobs – Sarah is a medical doctor, Sharan is a civil engineer. But in their downtime, they are fixated with escape rooms. An escape room is like an immersive puzzle - it's a team game which involves everyone getting locked into a room and having to solve riddles and crack codes to get out of it – all against the clock. Sarah and Sharan had their first escape room experience three years ago - they are now the best players in the UK. Jo Fidgen went to join them at an escape room in North London.
