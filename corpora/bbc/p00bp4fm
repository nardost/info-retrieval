We often contemplate the human condition on the Forum, but this week we go way beyond the process that took us from slime to civilization to look at death on a truly astronomical bigger scale: the end of the universe and all that’s in it. How long will it take? And what’ll be the last thing to unravel? Our voyage to the stars is with American astronomer Chris Impey. Also joining us, one of the world’s most successful modern art curators, Lars Nittve, with his vision for the next generation of art museums. And Iraqi born activist Zainab Salbi charts a course for the future that will see the empowerment of poor women, but warns that it will only work if men are involved too. Coming to grips with the end of the universe through art. Illustration by Bridget Kendall. Show less
