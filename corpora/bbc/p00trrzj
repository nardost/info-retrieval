In the second episode of our two-part series, Robert Elms continues his search for the musical soul of London. In this episode Robert discusses the pride that puts a swagger in the step of Londoners. He finds it in the characters of street sellers, wartime entertainers and the songs that were played in East End music halls. He maps the music shaped by Mayfair ballrooms, Soho basements and after-hours clubs in Ladbroke Grove. What do Robert's personal musical highlights reveal about the history and geography of the capital? How are the city's streets, people and characters reflected in its popular music? Songs about park life, protest, housing or just looking out over a dirty old river - they've become part of the musical bricks and mortar that give the city and Londoners, a sense of place. This series features songs by The Clash, David Bowie, Lord Kitchener, Gert and Daisy, Lily Allen, The Kinks, Noel Coward and many more. ***A podcast for this documentary will be available soon for UK listeners only*** (Image: Sir Noel Coward) Show less
