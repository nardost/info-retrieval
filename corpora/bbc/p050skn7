In 2012 Australian filmmaker Anna Broinowski was given unprecedented access to North Korea's film industry when she was allowed to spend three weeks with the country's top directors and actors. Jang Yeong-jin defected from North Korea to South Korea in 1997. His reason was unusual - he wanted to escape his unhappy marriage. It was only when he got to South Korea that he was introduced to the concept of homosexuality and realised he was gay. Image: Busy scene at a Pyongyang subway station.
