MEMORIES OF EMPIRE Andrew S. Thompson, Dean of Arts Faculty and Professor of Commonwealth and Imperial History at Leeds Universtiy is delivering tomorrow’s Trevor Reese Memorial Lecture at Kings College, London University entitled Living the Past. Public Memories of Empire in the Twenty-First Century. He argues that “The British, it might be said, have been attached to that imperial past like a mooring rope: the further they travel, the more they seem to feel its pull”. Should we try to forget out imperial past? Should we remember it differently? Can anything be gained by remembering Imperial history today? Laurie Taylor is joined by Andrew S. Thompson and Catherine Hall, Professor of Modern British Social and Cultural History to discuss the influence of Britain’s colonial past on its present, from foreign policy to British museums. FAMILY AND KINSHIP IN EAST LONDON Paul Barker, Senior Research Fellow at the The Young Foundation marks the 50 years anniversary of the publication of Family and Kinship in East London by Michael Young and Peter Wilmott.
