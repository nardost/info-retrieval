Indian paddle surfer Rocha Chacko Mathew used his expertise to save people stranded in their homes during the recent flooding in Kerala. He and his friends headed to the worst affected areas and pulled over a thousand people to safety. Lewis Miller is a floral designer with a difference. He secretly leaves flower arrangements in rubbish bins and other surprising places around New York to give a little something back to the city. Our reporter Tara Gadomski went with him on one of his “flower flashes.” British woman Tasha Bishop was born without a womb meaning she would never have a period, would never be able to carry her own children and having sex would be difficult. She was diagnosed with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome and struggled to come to terms with her condition. However, she decided to turn her experiences into something positive by launching a business called ‘The Pants Project’ that uses underwear to empower women.
