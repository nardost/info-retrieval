Jimmy Mizen was murdered in a senseless violent act in his local bakery in South London five years ago. He was only 16-years-old, and bled to death in his brother's arms. His parents Margaret and Barry Mizen were devastated by his death, but turned their tragedy into a campaign to help stop violence against other young people. And, from airline pilot to music maker - Armand Diangienda tells us how he set up the world's first black symphony orchestra in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Also on the programme, Irish journalist Declan Walsh who has devoted much of his life to reporting from Pakistan, tells us how he was suddenly ordered to leave the country on the eve of the General Election. The son of the tweeting and singing astronaut Chris Hadfield talks about his dad's big comedown from outer space. And in Witness we meet Peter Riva, the grandson of film star Marlene Dietrich.
