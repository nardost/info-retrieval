Five years ago in Pakistan the family home of journalist Kareem Khan was hit by a missile in a drone strike, killing his eldest son and his brother - he's now taking both the CIA and the Pakistani government to court. Kareem tells Jo Fidgen what it's like living under the threat of drone attacks. And from James Stewart to Ginger Rodgers - Jo Fidgen speaks to twin brothers Austin and Howard Mutti-Mewse who became pen-pals with some of the biggest stars in Hollywood during the 1980s while at school in England. They even went to some of their houses for tea and hung out with them in California. They've written a book about their adventures entitled "I Used to Be in Pictures". In this year's Winter Olympics in Sochi three Canadian sisters from the Dufour-Lapointe family all competed in the freestyle skiing mogul finals. Two of them - Justine and Chloe - won gold and silver medals. They tell reporter Melanie Brown about the family fascination with skiing. Radio presenter Christine Ntahe hosts a weekly show in her homeland Burundi where her guests are street children. Steven Kutcher is known as the "Bug Man of Hollywood". He can get a cockroach to flip onto its back and make a spider crawl on cue. Steven tells us how he's trained insects for more than a hundred films and TV adverts. Show less
