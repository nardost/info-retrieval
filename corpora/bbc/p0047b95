MENTALLY ILL IN INDIA In what's believed to be a first - one of India's leading mental health institutes, in the city of Ranchi, has published a list of patients who are now well enough to be discharged, but can't leave because their families have abandoned them. The BBC's Geeta Pandey goes to visit the institute to meet some of the patients left there. DESPERATE DREAMS BBC reporter Jenny Cuffe tells presenter Matthew Bannister about her forthcoming two part documentary series "desperate dreams" about the experiences of people trying to migrate from Africa to Europe. The series can be heard from next week in the Wednesday documentary on BBC World Service radio.
