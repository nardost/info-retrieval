Ed Cage from St. Louis, Missouri is passionate about beatboxing. So passionate that when his wife was pregnant with his daughter, Nicole, Ed would beatbox on her pregnant stomach. Twenty-four years later and Nicole is also a pro beatboxer. Together father and daughter have taken the world by storm. For the first 39 years of her life Constanza del Rio had no idea that was she adopted. So it was a huge shock to discover that she had been one of many babies informally adopted in Chile in the 1970s and '80s, often with the collaboration of the Catholic church. Shortly after she found out, she began the long and difficult search for her parents. Fifty-four-year-old Dave Smith is Australia's oldest pro boxer. He is also an Anglican priest and his friends call him 'Fighting Father Dave'. (Photo: Father and his family balance on a bike on the way to market. Credit: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images Show less
