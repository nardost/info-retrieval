On the male side of Patrick Burleigh's family is a rare hereditary condition known as precocious puberty. It has been passed down through the generations. It meant Patrick went through puberty when he was two, and by the time he was 12 he was passing as a 16-year-old and getting into serious trouble. Ballet is huge in Cuba. Dancers are treated like celebrities. For much of Cuba's modern history, most citizens needed visas to leave the Communist country. Ballet dancers were among the select few who could easily get out to perform around the world. However, many of those dancers defected and never returned. Rolando Sarabia was one of them.
