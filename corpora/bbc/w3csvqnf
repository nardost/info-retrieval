Memuna Sowe is Britain's midwife of the year according to the British Journal of Midwifery. Memuna stands out from many of her colleagues because she devotes her life to helping marginalised pregnant women, including asylum seekers and rough sleepers. Her family are originally from Sierra Leone. They inspired her to take up her chosen career: Dr. Blanca Huertas originally comes from Colombia - but she now works at the Natural History Museum in London where she has the title Senior Butterfly Curator. She looks after 5 million butterflies. She told Outlook that her fascination with these beautiful creatures began when she was growing up in Colombia. Henry Ng has spent the last 20 years hand crafting lion costumes for traditional celebrations in Singapore. He's one of the last full-time artisans of this craft.
