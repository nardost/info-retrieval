Austrian director Adrian Goiginger has made a film about a boy growing up with a heroin-addicted mother who used fantasy stories to protect him from the frightening world around him. The film has just won best director and best feature film at the Austrian Film Awards. The story is actually that of Adrian's own mother who made sure he grew up in a world full of love, in spite of her addiction. From an early age, Evan Ruggiero from New Jersey wanted to be on the stage and nothing was going to stop him - least of all the fact that he was diagnosed with bone cancer and his right leg had to be amputated as a teenager. He's now wowing crowds around the US. It's one thing to speak about the desire to end poverty, hunger and homelessness. It's something entirely different to actually do something about it, but the Branken family from South Africa have done just that. Reporter Mpho Lakaje went to meet them and heard how their lives have changed in ways they didn't expect. Dr Toby Capwell has a passion for knights, armour and jousting. His unique interest led him from America to the UK where he got a ringside part in a pretty extraordinary event five years ago. It was when the long lost remains of King Richard III were found under a car park in Leicester that the adventure really started for Toby.
