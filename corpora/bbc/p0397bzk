Nazir Afzal was one of the UK's most senior government lawyers until earlier this year. He used his position to take on the perpetrators of so-called honour killings, forced marriages, and street-grooming paedophile gangs. As one of the UK's most prominent Muslim lawyers, Mr Afzal gained a reputation for tackling sensitive cases associated with minority communities. We meet the heavy metal guitarist who discovered signs of liquid water on Mars. Originally from Nepal, Lujendra Ojha moved to the US when he was 16 years old. He's currently studying for a PhD in Planetary Science. Last month Michelle Payne became the first woman jockey to win Australia's top horse race - the Melbourne Cup. Naturally her 79-year-old father Paddy was very proud. He's a jockey turned trainer himself and Michelle is the youngest of his ten children. He brought them up alone after his wife died. Krzysztof Penderecki is the Grammy-award winning Polish composer and conductor, who in the 1960s combined classical and electronic music to create a new avant-garde sound. His Polish Requiem has been listed as one of the top ten compositions of the 20th century and his music has been used in Hollywood films like The Exorcist and The Shining. More recently he's been collaborating with the British band Radiohead, attracting a new generation of fans. (Picture: Nazir Afzal. Credit: Nazir Afzal) Show less
