Letty Hidalgo's son went missing when he was only a teenager. He is one of nearly 27,000 Mexicans who have 'disappeared' between 2006 and 2012. When the state stopped looking into his case, Letty took up the quest to find her missing son. She is now one of 16 relatives turned investigators behind a citizen-led forensic team set up to record and investigate these disappearances. They have enlisted the expertise of Dr Ernesto Schwartz, a Mexican academic leading a team at the UK's Durham University, to help train them, and they plan to launch their campaign across Mexico next month. The dancer Aakash Odedra talks about how dyslexia, James Brown and birds influence his classically trained Indian background. We speak to war journalist Aris Roussinos who specialises in covering the stories of rebels in conflicts all over the world. And, Shann Jones, an American radio talk show host who ended up running a farm in the remote Welsh countryside - where she found herself locked in a desperate battle to save her husband's life, armed only with natural remedies, the probiotic drink they make on the farm - and goats.
