When President Obama stepped into the White House back in 2008, many hoped his mixed heritage would help unite the country but eight years on America has never appeared more polarised. From Dallas to Nashville Chloe Hadjimatheou retraces a journey she took before Obamaâ€™s election across the southern states and stumbles across a gay community under attack, unfettered poverty in trailer parks, the last abortion clinic in Missouri and convicted murderers to find out why liberal and conservative, black and white, religious and secular Americans harbour so much animosity towards one another.
