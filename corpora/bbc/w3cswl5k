Hezni and Jilan Murad were happily married and deeply in love when so-called Islamic State started targeting the Yazidi community in Northern Iraq, where they lived. When IS militants entered their village, they took Jilan as a slave. Hezni promised he would find a way to save her. Today is Matthew Bannister's last programme on Outlook after an incredible 10 years. Jo Fidgen takes over part of the programme to say goodbye, with highlights chosen by listeners and the Outlook team. Hear long lost recordings from his first broadcasts in the 1980s, how he's become an unlikely star in Ugandan action movies, as well as touching moments from interviews over the years.
