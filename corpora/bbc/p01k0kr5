What is the most important aspect of working? Is it as simple as the money it puts in your pocket? Is it the people you work with? Or, is it the meaning you derive from what you do – the difference you make and the room you have for creative development? The Forum explores the notion of job satisfaction – what it means to us as individuals, and what difference it makes to a nation’s prosperity. Nobel Prize winning economist Edmund Phelps explains why innovation is the key. Norwegian Philosopher Lars Svendsen describes why finding meaning in what you do is essential to job satisfaction. And, artist and photographer Dyanita Singh admits that creating something new is the key but it comes at a cost because it is all consuming. Photo credit: Evrard/AFP/Getty Images Show less
