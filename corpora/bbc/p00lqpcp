Richard Coles confronts accusations that the West is attempting to force gay rights on Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Most Western states are keen to spread gay equality around the globe. But some local political and religious leaders often claim that homosexuality is a foreign import - leading to charges that the West is engaged in a new form of imperialism. Looking to the past, Richard Coles attempts to sort out historical fact from political propaganda - exploring the degree to which modern gay identity is a Western construct which has no place beyond Europe and North America. And he asks gay rights leaders across the world about the competing claims. (Image: A gay couple kisses during the 2nd Gay Parade Against Homophobia in Brazil. Credit: Getty) Show less
