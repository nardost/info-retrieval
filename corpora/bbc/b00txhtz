Last Broadcast Date: Mon 4 Oct 2010
Laurie Taylor explores the different experiences of au pairs in the UK and finds that the ( predominantly ) girls view of the families they work for is not always very positive. Laurie also talks to sociologist John Williams about his new biography of Liverpool Football Club and explores not only the early history of the club in the late 19th century and its place in the rapidly expanding seaport of Liverpool, but also how it has reflected the city it inhabits and how it fits into what some call Liverpool's 'exceptionalism'.
