IZZELDIN ABUELAISH A special edition of Outlook today devoted to a doctor from Gaza who refuses to hate. Izzeldin Abuelaish's life's mission has been to bridge the bitter divide between Israelis and Palestinians. The fertility specialist has helped childless couples from both communities to have babies. His determination to achieve peace in his region has never wavered, even when three of his daughters were killed after an Israeli tank fired on his home. Izzeldin's book is called I Shall Not Hate and is published by Bloomsbury. Show less
