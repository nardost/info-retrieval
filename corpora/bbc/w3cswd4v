Xinyuan Wang looks at the evolving magazine scene in China. With traditional news stands disappearing, what future is there for the many publications in the Chinese market? Starting her investigation in Shanghai, Xinyuan talks to the editorial team of CBN Weekly, a magazine which targets the business communities across China. She finds out how they market their publication and what challenges lie ahead for the printed version. CBN Weekly is providing content via social media apps that people can access on their phones, helping them survive in a changing environment. Xinyuan also looks at what political content is permitted in magazines, and which subjects are considered sensitive. She asks younger readers how they search for material on political topics, and discovers that magazines are unlikely to be their first choice. She is inspired by a magazine called Urban China, whose editor explains that he can deal with difficult topics around urban growth and the environment, and he feels that his readers benefit from a genuine two-way discussion on how they can change and improve their cities. Finally in Beijing she talks to a group of magazine subscribers about their tastes and interests, finding fashion much higher on the list than politics. (Photo: Xinyuan Wang) Show less
