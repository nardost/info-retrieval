Growing up in Nigeria, Dr. Bennet Omalu didn't really understand American football. However, since discovering a link between the sport and brain injuries, a Hollywood film has now been made about him. British actor Eddie Redmayne discusses the challenges of Danish transwoman Lili Elbe, who was one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery, back in the 1930s. And American journalist Rod Nordland faced a dilemma when he was covering the story of Ali and Zakia - a young couple in Afghanistan. Zakia is Tajik, and Sunni Muslim; Ali is Hazara, and Shia. When their relationship was discovered, they were forced to go on the run to stay together - and Rod had to decide whether he would help them. (Picture: Dr Bennet Omalu.
