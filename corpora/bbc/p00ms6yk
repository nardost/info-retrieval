Extraordinary personal stories from around the world. Two years after the Haitian earthquake, Outlook's Lucy Ash talks to Viviane Petit-Frere, a mother who lost three of her children in the disaster. Still struggling to cope with grief, her only comfort is that her son Hans Charles managed to survive thanks to the generosity of a stranger. Also today, the disabled Georgian weightlifter who is fighting prejudice as he trains for the Paralympic Games later this year. And we meet the man known as "the fastest flying human", Norwegian Espen Fadnes talks about base jumping and how he's mastered the art of flying like a bird.
