Amanda Playle's ordeal at the hands of a stalker began in 2014. She was living a quiet life with her husband and three daughters when she got a friend request on social media. Her stalker would turn out to be the last person she suspected. South African Marietjie Bothma went from living on the streets to speaking at former President Jacob Zuma’s inauguration. Mpho Lakage has been to meet her in Johannesburg to hear about her incredible journey. Dr Ruth Westheimer has made an improbable career by combining two of her passions: religion and sex. She’s a sex therapist who has become something of a cultural icon in the United States thanks to her frank discussions. Despite being 90 years old she has no plans to retire and this year has published two books, Stay or Go: Dr. Ruth’s Rules for Real Relationships and the illustrated autobiography, Rollercoaster Grandma! The True Story of Dr. Ruth. She's been speaking to Outlook's Emily Webb and began by telling her about her early life in Germany and the tragic way she learned her parents had been killed.
