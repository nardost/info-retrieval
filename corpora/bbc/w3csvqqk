Denise Fergus and her two-year-old son James Bulger had been out shopping when she let go of his hand for a split second. His killers, two 10-year-old boys called Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, abducted little James and brutally murdered him. The crime forced people around the world to re-think what children could be capable of. Now, 25 years on, Denise has written a book called I Let Him Go which tells her traumatic story in full for the first time. She tells Matthew Bannister about the struggle to overcome her son's death. Fray Tormenta is a legendary Mexican wrestling priest, famous for taking part in the choreographed theatrical sport of Lucha Libre. He fights for a good cause, raising the orphans he looks after, and he's been the inspiration for two films. Costume designer Ruth Carter has been working in theatre, film and TV for more than 25 years. She's the first black costume designer to be nominated for an Oscar and has worked on films including Do The Right Thing, Malcolm X, Amistad, Selma, and the new superhero film, Black Panther.
