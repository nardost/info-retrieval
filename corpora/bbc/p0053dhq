Personal stories behind the news from all over the world. With Matthew Bannister. Brother of the "Veil Martyr"; Phnom Penh water festival and Katie Piper's surgeon. The "Veil Martyr" Marwa El Sherbini was stabbed to death in front of her three year old son in a German courtroom. Her husband - who tried to save her - was also stabbed and then accidentally shot by a policeman. He was seriously injured. Mrs El Sherbini had been about to give evidence against Alexander Wiens who had subjected her to racial abuse because she wore the Islamic headscarf, when he attacked her with a knife. The case caused outrage in her native Egypt where she became known as "the veil martyr". Marwa's brother Dr Tarek El Sherbini spoke to Outlook about his family's ordeal. Phnom Penh Water Festival Things are getting back to normal in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh - after the city's biggest annual party. The three-day Water Festival marks the reversal in flow of the mighty river Cambodians call Tonle Sap. More than a million visitors descend on the capital to join in all the revelry - everything from music and dancing to family reunions along the riverfront. And most importantly of all, as Outlook's Guy De Launey found out, the boat-racing.

The story of her brave recovery from horrific and disfiguring injuries became the most popular on the World Service website for some days. During the interview Katie referred to her plastic surgeon, Mohammed Ali Jawad, as " her hero". He talks to Matthew about the pioneering techniques he used to help Katie's recovery. Show less
