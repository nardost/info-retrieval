Dr Nima Nyangan Sherpa was at Everest Base Camp when the earthquake that killed more than seven and a half thousand people in Nepal caused an avalanche on the mountain. He is the only person from his community to be trained as an expedition medic and is determined to return to the mountains. Award winning Somali writer Nuruddin Farah has been living in self-imposed exile for almost 40 years. Soon after he finished his latest book Hiding in Plain Sight an extraordinary thing happened, just like the protagonist's brother in the novel, his own sister was killed by a suicide bomb in Afghanistan. For the last 50 years Justo Gallego Martinez has been building a cathedral with his own hands using recycled materials. The former monk lives inside his creation which lies just east of the Spanish capital Madrid. Guy Hedgecoe went to meet him. Lacey Schwartz grew up in a Jewish family in upstate New York, but always had a slight doubt that the pieces didn't quite fit. So, she set out to find the truth and along the way uncovered a painful family secret. (Image: Dr Nima Nyangan Sherpa. Credit: Himalayan Medics) Show less
