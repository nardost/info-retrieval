City Boss Dame Helena Morrissey champions the life of Rachael Heyhoe Flint, the pioneer of women's cricket who was regarded as a ground breaker who ruffled feathers and shook up a male dominated sport. Helena Morrissey who has also made it to the top of her career in a male dominated word of the City, is founder of the 30% Club, a campaign group whose aim is to get a minimum of 30% women on FTSE-100 boards. Now working as Head of Personal Investing with Legal and General Investment Management, Helena makes the case for why Heyhoe Flint is a great life. She is joined by Dr Raf Nicholson who teaches history at Queen Mary University of London and is a writer on the women's game. The presenter is Matthew Parris and the producer is Perminder Khatkar.
