How does a frog cartoon become a hate symbol? Matt Furie is a comic book illustrator who created Pepe the Frog, a chilled-out character that ended up becoming a hugely popular internet meme. But this frog took on a sinister life of its own as it was adopted by far-right groups in the US. Neal Razzell finds out how this unexpected turn affected Matt and how he’s fought to reclaim his frog. Fabio Zaffagnini loves various types of rock. He’s an Italian geologist and is also obsessed with the band Foo Fighters. He knew they wouldn't perform in his small Italian city so instead he organised a concert where 1,000 musicians played one of their songs. This attracted the attention of the band’s frontman Dave Grohl, who went on to make Fabio’s dreams come true… Dubliner Derek McGuire gives guided walking tours in his home city in Ireland. But it’s not just standard tourist sights on his tour. He was once homeless in Dublin so he shows his customers a different side to the city’s streets. Outlook's Áine Gallagher joins Derek's audience to find out more. Image: Pepe the Frog Credit: Matt Furie Show less
