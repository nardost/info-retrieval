Despite the political uncertainty in the UK at the moment the country’s reputation for top-class education, if you can afford it, is still on the rise. Chinese students are worth around five billion pounds a year to the British economy, and brands like Eton, Harrow, Cambridge and Oxford attract pupils from across China with their promise of a traditional, privileged education. But what’s it like for young Chinese students to go to school so far from home and away from their parents? And is it really worth the money? Liyang Liu meets two very different school children who have travelled thousands of miles to go to private boarding school in the UK. Recorded over six months she finds out what happens when they get there. (Photo: Students receive their straight A results from Queens College. Credit: Getty Images) Show less
