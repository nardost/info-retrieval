When he was 19, BJ Miller almost died when he was struck by 11,000 volts during a freak accident - as a result, he lost an arm, and both legs below the knee. He went on to become a doctor and now helps people during their last days. He tells Neal Razzell why he believes death can be "a profound, personal, exquisite experience". BJ has co-written a book called â€˜A Beginner's Guide to the End'. This interview contains some graphic medical material. Bombino is a Tuareg guitarist, singer and composer - a master of what's sometimes known as the 'desert blues.' His love of the guitar began when he first heard his cousins playing. He's now been dubbed "The Sultan of Shred" and he's the first musician from Niger to be nominated for a Grammy. Image: Dr BJ Miller Credit: Owen Egan Show less
