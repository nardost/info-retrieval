Elisha Rose was in Sydney, Australia watching the TV news one day when she discovered that her father was wanted for murder. She was 13 years old at the time. She learned that her father had killed five people during the 1980s and 1990s and would be sent to prison for life. She talks to Outlook's Shaimaa Khalil about trying to come to terms with his actions. Golf is often seen as the sport of the rich. But in India, an unlikely golfing hero has emerged from the slums. The BBC's Rahul Tandon met Shiv Churasia who has gone from being a caddy to winning the Indian open. Russell Dagless is a British truck driver who managed, in rather dramatic circumstances, to save another driver's life on a busy highway in the UK. What's more, 30 years before that, Russell's life was saved by another driver during a road accident. When Nawaal Akram was growing up in Qatar, she was bullied for the way she walked. She has muscular dystrophy which is a condition that gradually causes the muscles to weaken. She ended up using a wheelchair when she was 12 and had to leave school. Her difficult childhood led to depression, but eventually she found a way out of it by becoming a stand up comedian and a model. Image: Elisha Rose in a library Credit: Mayeta Clark Show less
