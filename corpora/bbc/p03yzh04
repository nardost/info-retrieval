Massoud Hossaini is one of Afghanistan's most prolific photographers. He has gone to some of the most remote areas of the country and made it his mission to capture all aspects of Afghan life. Over the years he has photographed wars, presidents, parades and protests - and sometimes he has even been joined by his wife, a photographer at a rival press agency. Massoud talks about the near death experience in Kabul that won him the Pulitzer Prize.

Emma Cline is an American writer whose debut novel The Girls, is based on the true story of cult leader Charles Manson, the hippie dropout and failed pop star, whose followers carried out a series of murders in Los Angeles in 1969 under his influence.
