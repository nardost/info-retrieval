The city of Mosul has been occupied by IS since June 2014. Mohamed and his family were forced to flee, but he decided to set up a radio station, which broadcasts to people trapped under IS control. With very little access to outside news sources, residents of Mosul have been risking their lives to call into Mohamed's station. Every year a piece of street theatre is performed in Trinidad's capital, Port of Spain, to begin the annual carnival celebrations. It's called Canboulay and it originates from the 1881 riots when former slaves and their families rose up against attempts by the British governor to suppress their carnival. Outlook's Nicki Paxman met the woman who wrote the play, Trinidad's Poet Laureate, Eintou Pearl Singer. Karen Guthrie is a film-maker from Scotland.
