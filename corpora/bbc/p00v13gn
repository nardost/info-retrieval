Extraordinary personal stories from around the world: today we hear the story of Maajid Nawaz, the British Pakistani who was recruited into political Islam as a teenager and ended up travelling the world setting up cells for an extremist Islamist group. After being imprisoned in Egypt in 2002, Maajid was adopted by Amnesty International as a Prisoner of Conscience and he underwent a transformation - eventually renouncing political Islamism. He's now a leading campaigner against extremism. Also today we meet an American firefighter - known as a "smokejumper" - who tackles wildfires by parachuting towards the blaze. Show less
