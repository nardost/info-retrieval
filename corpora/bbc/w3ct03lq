Hossein Sharif is an Iranian boy, about to marry Hee Sue, a South Korean girl. As the families begin to meet, Sharif discovers all the criss-crossing roads that the couple's home countries have travelled. In the last 50 years, South Korea and Iran have switched places in the world table of economic prosperity. South Korea has risen while Iran has fallen behind. Hossein and Hee Sue's families begin to discover a parallel universe, a world of “might have beens” and divergent paths. When they first began dating, Hossein had to explain to Hee Sue how Iranians never walk alone. Stuck in an endless cycle of revolution and reform, only to see others pass them by, Hossein asks if can ever ditch the lost souls that follow you around? The ghosts of a glorious past: who constantly whisper in your ears: is there something wrong with us? That we started first but now we are last? Follow Hossein Sharif on a personal journey across London, Tokyo and Seoul as he seeks to answer the question before beginning a new life with Hee Sue.
