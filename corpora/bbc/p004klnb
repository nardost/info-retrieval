THE FORUM - A World Of Ideas - presented this week by art historian TIM MARLOW. In the programme: the interconnectedness of life on our earth, from the ancient past to the complexity of the global present. British paleontologist SIMON CONWAY MORRIS suggests that the future of evolution may be more predictable than we think. He also believes that if extra-terrestrials exist, not only will they be as bright us but they may think like us too. Polish philosopher and writer EVA HOFFMAN reflects on time and the way we experience it in our modern world. She warns we could be misusing what time we have with potentially damaging psychological consequences. And founder of The Climate Parliament NICHOLAS DUNLOP outlines a radical new scheme of global political co-operation to save the planet â€“ by creating regional 'supergrids' of renewable energy.
