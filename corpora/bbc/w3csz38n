Ernie Louttit was a rare thing in the 1980s - a police officer and Cree, one of Canada's many First Nations groups. He also had a reputation for re-opening case files on First Nations people that his colleagues had closed. When Ernie discovered that a case of a teenager, who had been found frozen to death, had been concluded without much investigation he knew he had to do more. He tells Neal Razzell about the aftershocks for his own career and for policing in Canada. Ernie's book is called: The Unexpected Cop: Indian Ernie on a Life of Leadership.
