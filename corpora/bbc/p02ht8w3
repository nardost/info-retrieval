Mubarak Batambuze, the fisherman from Uganda who killed the crocodile that ate his pregnant wife. He asked a blacksmith to make him a special spear then risked his own life to take revenge. He's now become something of a hero in his homeland. Also on Outlook, the story of Dora Morales, the Mexican psychologist who helps treat migrants in a safe house run by Médecins Sans Frontières. Every year around 300,000 migrants from central America travel north through Mexico hoping to reach the United States. Many complete part of the journey clinging onto the roof of an enormous freight train known as The Beast.
