HARRY KIERNAN Twelve years ago Harry Kiernan's wife Denise committed suicide. She had been suffering from progressive multiple sclerosis which is a degenerative condition. Because Harry had done nothing to stop her, he was convicted of second degree manslaughter and given a suspended prison sentence. After her death Harry wanted to help people in whatever way he could. So Harry, aged 57, has become one of only a handful of altruistic organ donors in the US - he gives his organs to complete strangers without payment. MAKING A DIFFERENCE 12 year old TJ Barrett Dunn and his 13 year old sister Sheneisha live on a housing estate in North London that was once plagued by gangs of youths. The violence got so bad that they were too frightened to go out and play. Frustrated by the lack of action, the kids came up with a scheme which takes a new approach to tackling gun and knife crime.
