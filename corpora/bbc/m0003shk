Many legal systems have allowed the accused the defence of a “crime of passion”: attributing their act to a sudden explosion of feeling, rather than pre-meditated violence. Prosecutors, though, have argued that “passion” is simply another word for “insanity” or “malice”. A panel with distinguished criminal records tries to draw the line in a discussion hosted by Matthew Sweet at the Free Thinking Festival, Sage Gateshead.
