Artino is from the Syrian capital Damascus. In 2013 he witnessed the Ghouta chemical attacks on the outskirts of the city in which hundreds of people were killed. The moving photos he took in the aftermath of that attack turned him into an accidental photo-journalist. Growing up Chinese in Indonesia was not easy for Nelson Nio. He was bullied a lot and learned to defend himself with martial arts. When he moved to the United States his martial arts expertise came in handy. Nio tells reporter Peter Bowes how he has now taught self-defence to thousands of women. Jack Lemmon was a well known American actor and comedian who died in 2001. His son, Chris, has been touring the world for a few years now with a tribute show to his father called A Twist of Lemmon. Friar Tomás González Castillo runs a shelter in southern Mexico where migrants travelling north towards the United States can take a break before trying to cross the border. An estimated 20,000 migrants from Central America are caught by criminal gangs in Mexico looking to kidnap them and hold them for ransom. (Photo: Syrian photographer Artino.
