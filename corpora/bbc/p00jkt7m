On Sunday 13 August 1961, Berliners awoke to find telephone wires cut and a wall being erected across the city. The wall, which ultimately extended for over 100 miles, separated them from family, friends and jobs for 28 years. In so doing, it became a potent symbol of the Cold War. On the 50th anniversary of the Berlin Wall going up Gerry Northam examines the Wallâ€™s political context and re-visits the day which signified the peak of the Cold War, the constant threat of nuclear war, and the human price paid for yet more failed ideologies.
