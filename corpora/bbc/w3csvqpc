What does it take to stand up to a dictator? Doctor Hussain al-Shahristani was one of Iraq's top nuclear scientists - hand-picked by Saddam Hussein to begin work on an atomic bomb. His refusal to do so landed him in prison, but it's a decision he's never regretted. In 2017 Juan Pedro Franco from Mexico was declared the heaviest man alive by the Guinness World Records. He'd been bedbound for seven years in his family's home and weighed 595 kilos which is nearly 94 stone. A doctor got in touch with Juan Pedro and has helped him lose a huge amount of weight. Molly Bloom made a fortune from hosting poker games for A-list celebrities in New York, but it turned out to be a murky affair. Her story is now a Hollywood film called Molly's Game which has been nominated for an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. (Picture: Hussain al-Shahristani.
