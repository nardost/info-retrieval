Doaa al Zamel from Syria has won an award for bravery after the most horrendous experience trying to reach Europe. She is just 19. Three years ago, her family fled the violence at home and tried to make a new life in Egypt. But it wasn't working out and Doaa and her fianc√©, Bassem, also a refugee - decided that they needed to uproot themselves again. So in September 2014, they paid their life savings - $5000 - to board a fishing boat carrying hundreds of people to Europe. Just 11 made it. Elliott Tupac is a Peruvian artist who uses attention-grabbing calligraphy to comment on social issues at home and elsewhere. His latest mural is in the north of England, where the Latin Vamos festival has been taking place. Helen Clegg caught up with him there. Last month, there was a lot of excitement in the world of ballet, when Misty Copeland became the first African-American principal dancer at the prestigious American Ballet Theatre company. One of those celebrating was Raven Wilkinson. She was one of the first African-American ballet dancers to get a place with a major company back in the 1950s - the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. The indigenous Sami people of Scandinavia have a unique musical tradition - yoiking. A yoik is a song made up of sounds rather than words, and each one belongs to a person or a thing, a landscape - it is almost like a name. Scottish musician Merlyn Driver grew up in the wilds of the Orkney Isles and has been working with Sami musicians. (Photo: A deflated rubber dinghy washed up on a beach.
