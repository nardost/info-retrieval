Reporter Lina Sinjab has been to visit two refugee camps in Iraqi Kurdistan to find out how the Syrian children there are coming to terms with the violence they've seen and their uncertain future. Also, British man Paul Stewart, who was paralysed after falling 200 ft off a cliff, talks about his recovery and how he went back to climb the same cliff face again. Anubha Rohatgi visits Tihar jail in India which has set up its own radio station and meets some of the prisoners who are getting in front of the microphone. Plus, the anti mafia judge turned best-selling-thriller-writer, Gianrico Carafiglio, explains how he used psychology to crack crime.
