Samuel Abdulraheem was just seven when he was snatched while playing outside his home in northern Nigeria. Six years later, at the other end of the country, he was found in a chance encounter with his sister Firdausi. They tell their astonishing story to Emily Webb. Dave Finney’s life has been transformed by looking after and racing husky dogs. He and his canine companions - King, Khya, Titan, Tazmin, Spirit, Koa, Eli, and Phantom - are dryland mushing champions in Ireland. Outlook's Áine Gallagher went to meet them. Jumping from the beautiful 450-year-old Mostar Bridge in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been a rite of passage for young men for centuries. It was a historic landmark before it was destroyed during the conflict of the 1990s and has since been re-built. Some have died in the attempt, but for the legendary diver Emir Balic it has been a life's work. Image: A boy on a sidewalk Credit: Getty Images Show less
