Kathy Eldon remembers her son Dan, who was 22-years-old when he was stoned to death by a mob in the Somali capital Mogadishu. It was 1993 and he'd been working as a photojournalist, documenting the country's famine and growing conflict. Kathy has just written a memoir called 'In the Heart of Life'. Matthew also talks to Felicity Aston, the first person to cross Antarctica "unaided and unpropelled".
