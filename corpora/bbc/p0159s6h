The Japanese barber Sunao Kato has re-opened his shop inside the exclusion zone around the Fukushima nuclear plant, despite there being very few customers. He tells Matthew why the experience has brought him closer to his wife. Also, we hear from the Zimbabwean refugee William Kandowe who has started a school for orphans in South Africa. And campaigner Miranda Gibson explains why she has spent the last 15 months living in the top of a giant eucalyptus tree in the Tasmanian Forest.
