What do Donald Trump’s tweets reveal about the man who, on 20th January, will be America’s next president? Will Donald Trump’s presidency be defined by one of the ways he us seen as winning over voters - by using Twitter to reach out over the heads of the “mainstream media’ - to motivate his core support, who turned out in numbers to defy the polls? Katty Kay asks what do Trump’s Tweets tell us about the man as he prepares for his Inauguration - will he continue to use what he has called his ‘beautiful” Twitter” account to tell the world what he’s thinking - and doing? When he makes an announcement - like stepping down from his business - he puts it out on Twitter. “I will be leaving my great business in order to Make America Great Again!" His Transition tweets were a commentary on the Cabinet selection process - “Just met with General Petraeus, was very impressed” - and he stirred a diplomatic row by commenting on China, after speaking to the president of Taiwan. But the Tweets are not all policy. Commenting about a TV satire about him, he wrote: “One side, biased, not funny at all”. A Broadway hit musical, where his vice president was booed - “ it isn’t all its cracked up to be”. So what is the strategy behind the tweets and what do they say really say about the man?
