CORPORATE PR Laurie Taylor is joined by Professor David Miller, author of a new book entitled Thinker, Faker, Spinner, Spy and Mark Borkowski, PR Practitioner, to discuss the idea that ‘Corporate Spin’ has launched a full scale assault on modern democracy to the point that lies, fakes and ‘dark arts’ are behind a bewildering array of untruths that completely mislead the media and the public. HIGHRISE LIVING Could our sense that so many modern cities look alike be the result of looking at them only from the outside – of considering exteriors rather than interiors? Dr Stephen Cairns picks up on some questions raised in last week’s programme about the city and talks about the findings of new research into highrise residential buildings currently being carried out at the University of Edinburgh.
